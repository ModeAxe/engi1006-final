Baby
You've been so distant from me lately
And lately
Don’t even wanna call you "baby"

[Pre-Chorus]
Saw us gettin' older (Older)
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high
Waiting up for you upstairs (Upstairs)
Why you act like I’m not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

[Chorus]
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare?
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I’m special (So special), yeah
And I’ll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I’m rare
To make me feel rare

[Verse 2]
Baby
Don't make me count up all the reasons to stay with you
No reason
Why you and I are not succeeding, ah-ah (Mmm, ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Saw us gettin' older (Oh)
Burnin' toast in the toaster (Ah-ha)
My ambitions were too high (Too high)
Waiting up for you upstairs (Upstairs)
Why you act like I’m not there? (Ah-ha)
Baby, right now it feels like (What?)

[Chorus]
It feels like you don't care
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare? (I'm so rare)
Always there
You don't do the same for me, that's not fair
I don't have it all
I'm not claiming to
But I know that I'm special (So special), yeah
And I'll bet there's somebody else out there
To tell me I'm rare
To make me feel rare (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
I'm not gonna beg for you
I'm not gonna let you make me cry (Ah, nah nah, make me cry)
Not getting enough from you (No-oh)
Didn't you know I'm hard to find? (Find, hard to find)

[Pre-Chorus]
Saw us gettin' older
Burnin' toast in the toaster
My ambitions were too high (Too high)
Waiting up for you upstairs
Why you act like I'm not there?
Baby, right now it feels like

[Chorus]
It feels like you don't care (You don't care)
Why don't you recognize I'm so rare? (So rare)

[Outro]
Ah, ah (So rare)
Rare
Ah, ah
Rare[Intro]
Yeah, I loved her too hard, she left me here with this guitar
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you
Now you're gone, I only see you through the phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you leave me alone, I guess you took it to the heart
Yeah, let's go

[Chorus]
It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, "Leave me alone"
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, "Leave me a—"

[Verse 1]
Sweat going down to my balls, I'm having withdrawals
Crazy baby yell at my scars shaped in hearts
Lamborghini Urus, Ferraris, extra cars
If you start bringing up love, I'm bringing my gun
I never knew I'd make it this far, it feels bizarre
But you know my energy large, like a Quran
And you know I work too hard, I came too far
I'm happy I'm still alive
'Cause half of my niggas they either died or in the system
Then if I ain't start rapping I swear to God I'd have been with them
I baguetteed out my watches, I'm a timeless ass nigga
I was creepin' on the low, yeah, I'm a doggy ass nigga
But I'm an honest nigga, I can only lie when it comes to snitchin'
I hold grudges with my bitches, if you lie I won't forgive you
Just don't go tell nobody about those times that I was with you
You got my shoulder to lean on if you want to cry, fuck a tissue
In and out of love so many fucking times, I don't get it
I could get on some gangsta shit, then turn the vibe sentimental
You say you front on my nigga and he ain't ride, wrong nigga
Swear it's way too many hoes that be dying over bitches (Yeah)
Yeah, let's go

[Chorus]
It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, "Leave me alone"
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, "Leave me a—"

[Outro]
I lost her heart, she left me here with this guitar
So if you plan on stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
'Cause I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Woah, if I write (It's JoeFromYO)
If I write you, girl, will you reply? (Go Grizz)
Follow my commands, come on, girl, comply
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
And I can see all them lies in your eyes
But I'm no different, selling dreams for tonight
Just so I could have my way, rubbin' on your thighs
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, but if I (But if I)
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply? (Would you reply?)
You know I used to be a thief up in the night (Yeah, yeah)
And you don't want that type of guy in your life
But what if I put on a disguise for the night? (Yeah, yeah)
What if I was to put my life up on the line? (On the line)
Don't pay no mind to them bitches, like a ticket, you're fine
Gave you a shoulder to lean on for when you cry

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Uh, cry for me, for me now
No one can slow me down
I stay with forty rounds
Hit her off a Perc', gave her forty rounds
Woah, I'm far from finished, I'm not done
I keep grabbing on her waist, she tryna run
Put my foot into it 'til she numb
Every time she moan, she be like, "Uh"
Uh, she switched up for the same dollar
She don't know the rules of the game 'cause she ain't have no father
Me and Artist, yeah, we know some of the same scholars
Me and Artist go home and we got the same problems
And we keep arguing about them same bodies
That's because you is my girl, you is my main body
Take you serious, you know I will not play about it
And if you wanna get better, baby, just pray about it

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
I play about it, but don't you go be fake about it
Just play your part and I won't ever complain about it
Should have called you beautiful more before you changed your body
Then you did your body, girl, yeah, you really changed about it

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
It's couples out here that's not eatin', we got plain scallops
And clam chowder, you gon' be raising my damn toddler
And I can't lie, baby girl, it ain't no way around you
Ain't nothin' to say about it, got niggas pull up and spray about it
I'm gone

[Verse 4: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, and when I say, "I'm gone"
Don't just say it right after me like it's some sing-along shit
You got mad when I said you could bring your friend along, yeah
I'm gon' fuck you to this, make this one your favorite song
And you even look sexy with no makeup on
And you ain't gotta ask me, girl, just take it off
I knew that you was nasty the way you take it raw
I just hope that you don't think I'm crazy, girl

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie & Lil Uzi Vert]
If I
Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply?
You know I used to be a thief up in the night
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
But what if I put on a disguise for the night?
And I can see all the lies in your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
You don't want this type of guy, right
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties (Yeah)

[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert & A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me would you reply?
Yeah, if I write you, can you reply?[Verse 1]
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

[Chorus]
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that[Verse 1: Bradley Cooper]
Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

[Refrain: Bradley Cooper]
I'm fallin'
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Verse 2: Lady Gaga]
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

[Refrain: Lady Gaga]
I'm falling
In all the good times
I find myself longing for change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now

[Bridge: Lady Gaga]
Oh, ha, ah, ha
Oh-ah, ha

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now

[Post-Chorus: Lady Gaga & Bradley Cooper]
In the sha-ha, shallow
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low
In the sha-ha, shallow
We're far from the shallow now[Intro]

Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What’s  up with you? I grew up with you
Used  to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

[Verse 1]
Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it

[Chorus]
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga

Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas

What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

[Verse 2]
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, "Wisen up, be a smart nigga"
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga

[Refrain]
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust

Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga

OhOh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow[Intro: Drake & Future]

I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade

Wheezy outta here[Verse 1: Charles Kelly]
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows

[Chorus: Charles Kelly & Hillary Scott]
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

[Verse 2: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelly]
Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah, all I  see is you

[Chorus: Charles Kelly & Hillary Scott]
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

[Bridge: Charles Kelly, Hillary Scott & Both]
Ooh yeah
What if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if It never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever?

[Chorus: Charles Kelly & Hillary Scott, Hillary Scott & Charles Kelly]
I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over
What if I never get over you?

Ayy, it cost to live like this, you heard me?[Verse 1]
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm

[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without

[Chorus]
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar

[Verse 2]
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without

[Chorus]

There's somethin' in the way you roll your eyes
Takes me back to a better time
When I saw everything is good
But now you're the only thing that's good
Tryna stand up on my own two feet
This conversation ain't coming easily
And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Verse 2]
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Walk me home in the dead of night
'Cause I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
Say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on
Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong, there is so much wrong
There is so much wrong goin' on outside[Intro: T Pain]

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
She used to work at King of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every week, you should've seen her
The way she did it, nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit for my birthday
And I can tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil' mama getting it in all on her worst day
Lil' mama getting it in, she fit the school and the gym into her workday
I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you not his chick
She wanted a nigga and got the right one
I wanted to bag, she lookin' like fun
Pull up on me, baby, and spend the night, ah
They sayin' I'm sprung, they right

I can't let you go without me

Ooh, bring it back
She put that pussy on me, she know how to make it clap, make it clap
I make it clap, yo, I make it clap, yo
I have them haters asking, "How you up in that Rolls?"
And how them umbrellas coming out of locked doors?
How the front doors open up like the back doors?
I'll be like, "You ain't rich enough
You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini, on the beach sittin' up"
Now you bitching up, now your bitch with us
She said, "That champagne nasty," spit it up
Tory took one line and made a hot song
Now the chicks want tapes, I am not gone
But it's been five times, you ain't catch on
Maybe on the next song

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & T-Pain]
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me (Ooh)

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
You're so sexy to me

Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth (All I ever asked was for)
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you (Almost believed you)
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out (Find my way out)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Post Malone]
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (Ice)
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (Yessir)
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening (Straight up)
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travis Scott]
Love (Love, yeah)
Shorty gon' back (Shorty gon, shorty gon' back)
Need it on sight (Need it on, need it on sight)
Crack it all back (Crack it all, crack it all back)

All of my gang (All of my, all of my gang)
Shawty went bad (Shawty went, shawty went bad)

Hundred Percocets, I took like four or five off the rip

Learned from watching Goodfellas to keep it in the cupboard
Guns are just like pussy, pull it out, you better bust it
I might be in traffic in rush hour like Chris Tucker
Lord, I keep that MC Hammer, no you cannot touch it
I might go on tour and fuck a daughter and her mother
Pour some drank that's red like Robitussin, ayy
If I get pulled over, put my coke inside your crack, yeah
We get home, I pop a pill and I'll blow out your back, yeah

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

[Verse 1: Powfu]
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)

[Verse 2: Powfu]
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

[Chorus: beabadoobee, Powfu, beabadoobee & Powfu]
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Interlude]
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
(And it's like, wait, like, when?)

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance

[Chorus]
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

[Bridge]
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake

What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Come down

She fill my mind up with ideas
I'm the highest in the room (It’s lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let's go)

She saw my eyes, she know I'm gone (Ah)
I see some things that you might fear
I’m doin' a show, I'll be back soon (Soon)
That ain't what she wanna hear (Nah)
Now I got her in my room (Ah)
Legs wrapped around my beard
Got the fastest car, it zoom (Skrrt)
Hope we make it outta here (Ah)
When I'm with you, I feel alive
You say you love me, don't you lie (Yeah)
Won't cross my heart, don't wanna die
Keep the pistol on my side (Yeah)

She fill my mind up with ideas (Straight up)
I’m the highest in the room (It's lit)
Hope I make it outta here (Let’s go, yeah)

We ain't stressin' 'bout the loot (Yeah)
My block made of quesería
This not the molly, this the boot

Turn it up 'til they can't hear (We can't)
Runnin', runnin' 'round for the thrill
Yeah, dawg, dawg, 'round my real (Gang)
Raw, raw, I been pourin' to the real (Drank)
Nah, nah, nah, they not back of the VIP (In the VIP)
Gorgeous, baby, keep me hard as steel
Ah, this my life, I did not choose
Uh, been on this since we was kids
We gon' stay on top and break the rules
Uh, I fill my mind up with ideas

[Outro][Verse 1]
It's been a wreck me week
Sixty plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day 'til I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

[Chorus]
Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Sí, lo sabes
Mmm, este el remix
Doja, rrr

[Coro: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay que adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo (Ah)

[Verso 1: Nicki Minaj]
Cada vez que me tomo un descanso, el juego después es aburrido
Hermosa como Naomi, Cassie, más Lauren
Rapeo como Weezy, Foxy, más Lauryn
Rebota como Rams, mira, ahora ese es Gordon
No entienden que la bolsa está hablando, soy extranjera
Cuando piensan que superarán a la reina, comienzan a caer
Palabras a mis tiros de culo soy tan descarada
Los tengo tratando de golpear mi trasero como la joven Keke
Sí, soy ghetto, palabras para Gepetto
Además, soy pequeña, ¿dónde están mis zapatos?
Dile a Mike Jordan, envíame mis Retros
Solía ​​ser bi, pero ahora solo soy hetero
No estoy hablando de medicina, pero lo hice morfina
Desde que puse mi vagina en cuarentena
Él conoce esta cosa "A1" como un delito grave
Todo lo que tiene que hacer es decir la palabra como un concurso de ortografía

[Coro: Doja Cat]
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay que adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo (Sí)

[Verso 2: Doja Cat]
Déjame chequear mi pecho, mi respiración, un segundo (Ja)
Él nunca había visto un vestido así (Ah)
Él nunca se había impresionado así
Es probablemente porqué se quedó callado toda la noche como zip
Lo quiero, lo amo, lo necesito, mucho
Lo llevo, lo adueño, lo robo, rápido
Chico, deja de jugar, agárrame el culo
¿Por qué estás tan tímido? (Caliente)
Calla, quédatelo, continúa
¿Por qué no eres directo?
Sabiendo que quieres esta mujer
No lo niegues hasta que pruebes (Sí, sí)
Todas estas perras odiando porque te tengo conmigo
Todos mis negros dicen que estás muy comprometido
Más auténtica que las que tuviste, y linda
Todo lo del cuerpo-erpo, el culo y las tetas

[Coro: Doja Cat]
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay necesidad de adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo
Del día a la noche a la mañana, quédate conmigo en el momento
Te lo habría dicho si lo supiera, ¿por qué no lo dices?
Ni siquiera me di cuenta, no hay necesidad de adaptarse
Tienes que mantenerme concentrada; ¿lo quieres? Dilo

[Post-Coro: Doja Cat & Nicki Minaj]
Mmm-mmm, ajá, ah (Sí, lo sabes)
Ajá, ajá, ajá (Sí, lo sabes)
Mmm-mmm, ajá, ah (Sí, lo sabes)
Ajá, ajá, ajá (Sí, lo sabes)

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Podrías haberlo dicho
Chico, deberías haberlo dicho
Dilo, dilo
Me vestí solo para sentarme en la casa
Las personas que menos hacen siempre hacen más
Estoy contando dinero mientras él me chupa los dedos de los pies
Realmente sucio con esas bolas, todo neto, sí, soy asquerosa
¿Por qué estás hablando de quién es el cuerpo falso?
Con todos los rellenos en tu cara, estás llena de odio
Ese verdadero culo no mantendrá a tu negro en casa
Ahora te ves tonta, esa es la palabra de silicona[Verse 1]
We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn’t wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

[Chorus]
And we were leather jackets hangin’ onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

[Verse 2]
We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

[Chorus]
We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
"Pour Some Sugar On Me"
We were a top down at Johnson’s field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there’s a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

[Chorus]
We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin’ out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do

[Outro]
My friends say
"Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her"
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we were[Verse 1]
Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Verse 2]
And hey, babies, crawlin’ on the carpet
No, you won’t be that little for long
One day, you’ll move away, but you’re still gonna stay
This innocent after you’re gone

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I hope when we get to Heaven
He looks at us all like we're kids
Shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
Forgives all the wrong that we did

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
I hope we never have to grow up
We'll say for worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, oh
I'll always remember you young[Intro: Trace Adkins & Blake Shelton]
Hey
Yeah?
Tell 'em that story you were tellin' me

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Couple boys clock out 'bout 5:35
Tryna put a little hammer in their head
Standin' in the liquor store, starin' at a fifth
But they picked up a handle instead

[Refrain: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right?)
Hell right (Okay)

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins, Both]
Couple girls with their boots on got their Bluetooth on
T-shirts sayin' "Go Sooners"
Then the girl from the small town took off the "Old Town"
Put on a little Hank Jr. (Thank God)
Hell right
She got all her rowdy friends comin' over tonight

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise Hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right

[Verse 3: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
There's a guitar on the ground that was makin' some sound
'Til somebody pulled a hillbilly slip
Now there's fog on the window, she never woulda kissed him
If he didn't play a lick like this

[Refrain: Trace Adkins]
Hell right
Hell right

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right

[Bridge: Blake Shelton, Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Now it's 7 A.M.
Damn, if there ain't an empty handle on a square hay bale
Everybody's passed out drunk, but when they wake up
They're all gonna hurt like hell, right
Yeah, boy

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Hell right (Hell right)
Hell right (Hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right
Hell right

If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

No time to die, mmm
No time to die, ooh

I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind
I know that a dollar ain't worth a dime
Just trying to keep up with the Joneses at the end of the block
I know you get tired, I know you get down
I know you get sick of this soul-sucking town
But let's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

[Verse 2]
Open sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7
Let that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair
And let that windshield frame the ocean
Radio keep coast-to-coastin'
If we don't get where we're going baby I don't care
I'm already there

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me
I never gotta wonder where my honey be
I ain't savin' all my sugar for a Saturday night
Seven days a week I got an appetite
The sunset's like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen
Don't waste another mile or a minute not kissin' me
Life is short, make it sweet

Days will be long but the years will fly right by
We'll never be as young as we are tonight
Baby ain't that right, yeah

Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue, but my new coupe is slime green
My boys whip work 'til the white turn all tan (Tan)

Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted (Let's get it)

Balmain jeans, on the front got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker

Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July cold just like December
It's too low, then the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip, yeah
Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many (Yeah)
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, lemme go for the finish

Told a fuck nigga, "Don't touch my crumpet" (No)
She a lil' thot, can't wife no bird
Four years, I ain't touch no chick

I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back (Back, back)

Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back (No way)
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with the racks (These racks)

Hit my head, forget I'm me (I love it), oh my God
Without the God in the XY (Yeah, yeah)

'Cause true kings don't die, we multiply, peace

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
I'm so unbothered, I'm so unbothered
Y'all be so pressed while I'm raisin' daughters
Sons of empires, y'all make me chuckle
Stay in your struggle, crystal blue water
Piña colada-in', you stay Ramada Inn
My baby father, bloodline Rwanda
Why would you try me? Why would you bother?
I am Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter
I am the Nala, sister of Naruba

Ankh on my gold chain, ice on my whole chain
I be like soul food, I am a whole mood

'Cause I've bet on myself

Ancestors in my step
Now, I move

And I live on, on
I feel a change goin' on
Royalty in my blood, run the kingdom
The more money, more problem season
But don't nothing get you out your way
Rise up higher
Jump, jump and don't look down
You're so far from the ground
Yeah, yeah-eh-eh-eh

Yoom[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

[Outro]
Combat, I'm ready for combat[Intro]
Mmm yeah
Mmm hmm

[Intro]
Well since we been done
I’ve been trying to un-fall apart
And I’ve been thinking that some neon lights
Would be a real good start
Well I called a couple friends
But they all say they’re staying in
So I guess I’m going out on my own
I might be heart broke
But that don’t mean that I gotta stay home, yeah

[Chorus]
I can buy my own drinks
And I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
‘Til I can stop thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him
I don’t need nobody else
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Verse 2]
I found myself a dive
The type that he would never walk in
And then a guy at the bar sees an empty drink in my hand
Yeah, I said, "It's sweet of you to ask
If you could fill my glass
But I’m gonna have to pass this time"
Me and myself, well, yeah we’re doing just fine

[Chorus]
I can buy my own drinks
And I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself
‘Til I can stop thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him
I don’t need nobody else
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Bridge]
I can walk my own self to the front door
I can take my own self to bed
I can medicate my own headache
Yeah, I can be my own boyfriend

[Chorus]
And I can buy my own drinks
I can pay my own tab
And at the end of the night when they cut on all the lights
I can call my own cab
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
I can dance all by myself (No time to stop)
‘Til I can stop thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him
I don’t need nobody else
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Yeah, I can buy my own drinks
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Outro]
I can drop my own change in the jukebox
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
(Thinkin’ ‘bout drinkin’ ‘bout him)
I can dance all by myself
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)[Intro]
I'm so tired of pretending
Where's my happy ending?

[Verse 1]
I followed all the rules
I drew inside the lines
I never asked for anything that wasn't mine
I waited patiently for my time
But when it finally came
He called her name
And now I feel this overwhelming pain
I mean it's in my veins
I mean it's in my brain
My thoughts are running in a circle like a toy train
I'm kinda like a perfect picture with a broken frame
I know exactly who to blame

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen

[Verse 2]
Being nice was my pastime
But I've been hurt for the last time
And I won't ever let another person take advantage of me
The anger burns my skin, third-degree
Now my blood's boiling hotter than a fiery sea
There's nobody getting close to me
They're gonna bow to the Evil Queen
Your nightmare's my dream
Just wait until they fall to my wicked schemes

[Chorus]
I never thought of myself as mean
I always thought that I'd be the queen
And there's no in between
'Cause if I can't have that
Then I would be the leader of the dark
And the bad
Now there's a devil on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean

[Verse 3]
Something's pulling me
It's so magnetic
My body is moving
Unsure where I'm headed
All of my senses have left me defenseless
This darkness around me
Is promising vengeance
The price that I'm willing to pay is expensive
There's nothing to lose
When you're lonely and friendless
So my only interest is showing this princess
That I am the queen
And my reign will be endless (Endless)

[Bridge]
I want what I deserve
I want to rule the world
Sit back and watch them learn
It's finally my turn

[Chorus]
If they want a villain for a queen
I'm gonna be one like they've never seen
I'll show them what it means
Now that I am that
I will be the ruler of the dark and the bad
'Cause the devil's on my shoulder
Where the angels used to be
And he's calling me the queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)
(Calling me, calling me)
The queen of mean (Calling me, calling me)

[Outro]
I want what I deserve[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walkin' on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Hate me, hate me, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing...

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding with Juice WRLD]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

[Pre-Chorus: Ellie Goulding]
It's a thin line between all this love and hate (Okay)
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place (Okay)
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate (Okay)
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate (Okay)

[Chorus: Ellie Goulding with Juice WRLD]
And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

Goodnight[Verse 1]
Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

[Verse 2]
I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

[Bridge]
When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band[Intro]
EarDrummers

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Tell 'em again, tell 'em off (Tell 'em off)
It just dawned on me (On me), what's right, feels wrong
No, no wingman, that's only my A-game
At this game, two can play
Kill your vibe, they don't have the right
Baby don't fight it, you're giving me life
Take your time, set the mood right
Settle down, skeptical at first but now I'm not

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, yeah, saving my time for you
Suddenly I freed up (Free)
Freezing my times with you
When I'm lonely, I can bring them up
Closed off my line for you (Closing down my line)
I'm better when I'm just on my own, girl
Standing in line for you (Standing in line for you)
Standing here for I don't know how long, girl
Things I wrote (Ayy), lengths I go
Lets you know that I want you
Words we spoke (Yeah), things you wrote
Let me know that you want me too (Yeah)
Ikebe, pressing on me heavy
Pressing up against me real close
Bakasi, moving on me wassy
Time is moving real slow

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)
Won't be late, won't delay (Hey)
Won't be late, won't delay (Yeah)[Verse 1]
24 seconds, yeah, you better not stop
You got 24 seconds, can you beat the shot clock?
What you waitin' on, lil' daddy? I ain't got that much time
You seem anxious, you seem adamant but you ain't pressed my line
Wondering why, why, why (Oh why)
Know you ain't shy, shy, shy (Oh why)
I'ma say bye, bye, bye, better know I won't think twice (Yeah)
Better let go of your pride (Do-do)
Do it now (Do-do), just do it now (Do-do), oh yeah
(Do-do)

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now

[Chorus]
Shot clock
(Don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock

Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, you gon' miss your opportunity)
Shot clock
(Like don't sleep, don't sleep, nigga, pick up your feet, my nigga)

[Verse 2]
Five years of dating, tired of being patient
What the fuck you're waiting for? Oh, yeah
It's a lot of niggas hating and I don't entertain 'em
But damn, you gotta give me more
(Shhh, I know, I know and I'm really trying, but...)
Oh-ohh, if you don't want it like me
I could think about a hundred things I could be doing right now
Than wasting my time with you, oh (Do-do)
Okay, okay, since you gotta have it your way (Do-do)
I'm have to start that clock on you (Do-do)
We gon' see what's up

[Pre-Chorus]
When that nigga pull up on me, tell that nigga back, back
Don't you know all of these niggas wish that they could bag that?
I'm just saying, boy, you're playing, you're gon' let it wind down (Wind down)
You got 24 seconds and it's starting right now (Right now, yeah-eah)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
L, Love
Add "-rs" and that's surely what we are
Flip it 'round, add "-ve" and let's see if this goes far
Full of chuckles and cuddles and sometimes, eye puddles
Compose love like we're Mozart[Intro: Young Thug]

[Verse 1: Young Thug]

There go lil' mama, I don't wanna fuck her, she burnin', she trippin' (Woah)

Underdog, I gotta name to save
Some niggas won't ever get out (No, surf)

[Intro: Bad Bunny]
Yeh, yeh, yeh

[Estribillo: Bad Bunny]
Pensaba que te había olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, eh, eh, eh
Que cantamo’ bien borracho'
Que bailamo' bien borracho’
Nos besamo' bien borracho' los dos
Pensaba que te había olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, eh, eh, eh
Que cantamo' bien borracho'
Que bailamo' bien borracho'
Nos besamo’ bien borracho’ los dos
Pensaba que te había olvida'o

[Verso 1: J Balvin]
Justo cuando creía
Que por comerme a do’ o diez, te olvidaría' (Yeh)
Cogí un respiro y me salí de la vía
Y como un pendejo, no sabía lo que hacía
Nunca lo superé, nunca te superé (No; no)
Hasta me aprendí to'a la' balada’ en inglé' (Yeh)
Respiré y conté hasta tres (Uno, dos, tres)
Ere' la fantasía oscura de Kanye West, bebé, ey
Hace tiempo lo barato me salió caro (Yih)
Yo sólo twitteo, bala' loca' disparo (Yih)
¿Cómo olvidar la bellaquera en el carro?
¿A que guió solo?

[Estribillo: J Balvin & Bad Bunny]
Pensaba que te había' olvida'o (Pero no), yeh
Pero pusieron la canción, yeh, yeh
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamo' bien borrachos
Nos besamo' bien borracho' lo' dos
Pensaba que te había' olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, yeh, yeh
Que cantamo' bien borracho'
Que bailamo' bien borracho'
Nos besamo' bien borracho' los dos, ey, ey

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny]
Y hace tiempo que no venía' a mi cabeza
Pero ya van par de cerveza'
Y me acordé de cómo tú me besa'
De to' lo' polvo' encima 'e la mesa
Y en el carro, la playa, y el motel
En casa de tu pai', cuando yo te iba a ver
Las vece' que tu mai' no' llegó a coger
Tú brincando mojaíta', sudando Chanel
Yo sé que lo nuestro e' cosa de ayer
Y me pone contento que te va bien con él
Yo ni te extrañaba ni te quería ver
Pero pusieron la canción que te gustaba poner
Y me acordé de ti, cuando me hiciste feliz
Se acabó, pues, me fui, ey
Yo mismo me río de mí porque—

[Estribillo: J Balvin]
Pensaba que te había' olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, yeh, yeh
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamo' bien borrachos
Nos besamo' bien borracho' lo' do'

[Interludio Instrumental]

[Outro: Bad Bunny & J Balvin]
Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto, eh
Pero te soñé despierto, ey
Hoy salí pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento', el corazón desierto
Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te soñé despierto
Hoy salí pa' la calle sueltoSin sentimiento', el corazón desierto[Intro]
I promise that you'll never find another like me[Intro]
Tell me...
(LilJu made this beat)
Tell me, is it love, is it love again? Oo-ooh

[Verse 1]
Ayy, big ol' freak, huh? Big booty, big ol' treat
I'ma make him wait for the pussy
Hit it, then he big ol' skeet (Baow, baow, baow)
Feet on the bed, I'll fuck him up in the head
Suck it then look in his eyes then the next day, I might leave him on read (Mwah)
Pop it, pop it, daydreaming 'bout how I rock it
He hit my phone with a horse so I know that mean come over and ride it
Shit, I'm on the way, ride on that dick, I'm like, "Yay" (Hey)
Usually I like to fuck but tonight, we gon' make love cause you bae
Nobody know, I fuck with him on the low
We never show up together but I text him when I'm ready to go
Ayy, I had a couple of shots at the bar
I'm finna play with that dick in the car
I got him swervin' and breakin' the law
These windows tinted so nobody saw

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody freak like me (Huh)
Give ya what you need like me (Huh)
Ain't nobody got up on they tip-tip toes
Then rode to the tip like me (Huh)
I got him addicted, he fiendin'
My body a drug and he need it
He beggin' me for the treatment
He throw a fit when I leave him

[Chorus]
He like, "Baby let me rub, let me rub on ya'
Can I get a lil' love, lil' love from ya'?"
My body addictive, it's driving him crazy
I think I gotta run from him
Don't know what to do without it
He fuckin' with you? I doubt it
They don't understand that I'm all in his head
And it's nothin' to do with my body

[Post-Chorus]
You been fiendin' for me lately, going brazy, brazy
I got what you need, I'm gon' give it to you baby
Goin' brazy, brazy, fiendin' for me lately
I got what you need, I'ma give you what you craving

[Verse 2]
See, I'm a big ol' freak, I love to talk my shit
And you must be a pussy boy if you get offended
Bitch, it's Tina Snow, they love me 'cause I'm cold
And you can't take no nigga from me, I got mind control
I wanna fuck in the mirror, I like to look at your face when you in it
Come in the room and I'm givin' commands, I am the captain and he the lieutenant
I need that neck like a muh'fuckin pendant
Need you to spit, make that muh'fucker glisten
Tell him, "Shut up," make that muh'fucker listen
I bet he gon' like it, he won't do no trippin'

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody freak like me (Hell nah)
Give ya what you need like me (Hell nah)
Ain't nobody got up on they tip-tip toes
Then rode to the tip like me (Huh)
I got him addicted, he feenin'
My body a drug and he need it
He beggin' me for the treatment
He throw a fit when I leave him (Aah)

[Chorus]
He like, "Baby let me rub, let me rub on ya'
Can I get a lil' love, lil' love from ya'?"
My body addictive, it's driving him crazy
I think I gotta run from him
Don't know what to do without it
He fuckin' with you? I doubt it
They don't understand that I'm all in his head
And it's nothin' to do with my body

[Post-Chorus]
You been fiendin' for me lately, going brazy, brazy
I got what you need, I'm gon' give it to you baby
Goin' brazy, brazy (Ooh, ooh)
Fiendin' for me lately (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I got what you need, I'ma give you what you craving

[Outro]
Tell me, is it love, is it love again? Oo-ooh[Intro]
You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Verse 2]
I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

[Chorus]
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

[Outro]
Money in your palm don't make you real

Fuck it, buy a pink Mercedes (Skrrt)
I made Forbes every year, lil' baby (Top the Forbes)
I don't like no long nails on my lady (Of course)
Is it you that can't reveal that I'm shady?
White toes in her heels, she the latest (Toes)
She got plastic Cartiers, think she made it (She made it)
Sucked it in the car and then my kids met the pavement
Extended pumps and F&Ns like The Matrix (Young SEX)

[Verse 1]
Diamonds on me wetter than a tub
Shoppin' every day 'cause we used to be fucked up
Keep a yellow Cinderella on the tuck
YYB's on, ain't no way I'm givin' up
Different color diamonds on me, bitch, I'm dead wrong
And my bitch in Saudi Arabia, but her redbone (She red)
I got money, niggas doubted, now I'm mad on (Mad on)

I keep exotic drinks and juices by the crates (Young SEX)
She put my cum in her cup like it was shake
I'll never fuck this bitch again, it was a mistake
I'm Teletubby, diamonds green, blue, white, and grape
I can afford these black diamonds like a spade (Oh)
I maneuver through the city with a maid
I got riches and I guard 'em like the Navy
Pin it up and let me drink it like you're naked (Let's go)
It don't matter the ho call like mine baby (It don't matter)
Got a lil' money to leave your head on the pavement
Flawless carats got these niggas stand in they places
AR'd up before I come and issue statements (Young SEX)

My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)
What I look like with all them twenties? (Huh?)
Know them hoes like how I'm coming (Yeah)
What I look like with all this money? (Huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (Uh)
When I crack a smile, white gold (Bling)

Yeah, backend Baby (A hundred)
That's what they pay me a show (Let's go)
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more (Uh-huh)
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that ho

[Chorus: DaBaby]
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife

Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine (Alright)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Nope
Too raw, dope (Yeah)
You know I'm one of the G.O.A.T.'s
She let me put it in the back of her throat
Walk in the bank with a M in a tote (Yeah)
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money (Pow, pow)

Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that "ya'll come back" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Verse 2]
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Bridge]
It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Outro]
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town[Verse 1]
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy

[Verse 2]
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

[Chorus]
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

[Post-Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

[Bridge]
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

[Outro]
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy

And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans (What?)
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug

[Verse 1]
If you talkin' 'bout the work, nigga, just hide that, supply that
Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your hometown projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick all inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never, ever, ever keep in contact (Yeah)
Just closed case, so a nigga can't find that, baby, where your mind at?
Come here, girl, sign that, matter fact, oh, never mind then
Front door, find that after the climax
And she screamin' my name every time we behind it
When I heard the door, get up, baby, where my nine at?
Water on my neck, 3D like it's IMAX (Water)
Diamonds turned a bird to a goddamn blind bat
Ass so fat that I got to hit beside that
Heard a nigga put his Lamb' trucks on finance (Finance)
Woah (No, no, no), y'all niggas insane
No, we're not the same, I'm more like a big body (Skrrt), you like a Range
These niggas, they frauds, they repping my gang (Vroom)
Like, what's up with that? (No, for real)
I just pulled up Maybach, yeah, and that shit all matte black, yeah

[Chorus]
I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans (What?)
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with the plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug

[Interlude]
(Ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Drip so hard), it's Lil Uzi Vert
Uh, woah (Made it rain in this bitch), it's Lil Uzi Vert
I got on my Chrome Hearts (Yeah, yeah)
One, two, three, let's go (It's Lil Uzi Vert)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, ever since Clifford, yeah, Uzi been the big dog
Drippin' in this Ragu, you know I got the big sauce
Every outfit, yeah, I gotta get the pic' off
Said I know, I know you gon' return to the big boss
Ran this shit back like a motherfuckin' kickoff
(I just ran this shit back like a motherfuckin' kickoff)
Forty-five-hundred for some Margiela kick-offs
Got the yellow diamond Patek on my wrist, too pissed off
Laughin' to the bank, it's funny (Ha-ha)
Go get you some, go get your own money
Hold on, I got you with some loan money
No, matter fact, you ain't help me when I had no money
Three-hundred thousand, yeah, that's your money
Twenty more million, that's tour money
If you fuck me good, that's your money (Woah)

[Chorus]
I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy but sometimes she bougie

I just bought the Maybach, yeah

Wait, what the fu—
Why am I strapped in?
Wait, I just gotta hit this button, I'm—
I'm out[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Justin Bieber]
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (No)

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Ed Sheeran]
I don't like nobody but you, it's like you're the only one here

I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Justin Bieber]
'Cause I don't care (Don't care)
When I'm with my baby, yeah (Oh yeah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh[Verse 1]
This mornin' I got up at 6:01
I walked out and saw the rising sun
And I drank it in like whiskey
I saw a tree I've seen a thousand times
A bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind
And it hit me
It's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Verse 2]
I went back in and fired the coffee up
She walked in the kitchen like she always does
In my t-shirt and it killed me
And I kissed her like it was the first time
She laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind
I said "Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough"

[Chorus]
Some days you just breath in
Just try to break even
Sometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest
Sometimes it's just beatin'
Some days you just forget
What all you've been given
Some days you just get by
And some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Like you never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missing
Some days you're living

It'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear

[Chorus]
Some days you start singin'
And you don't need a reason
Sometimes the world's just right
Your clear eyes ain't even blinkin'
Got a heart full of grateful
For all you've been given
Some days you just get by
Yeah some days you're just alive
Some days you're livin'
Some days you're livin'

[Post-Chorus]
Livin' like you'll never die
Blue's a little bluer up in the sky
You're high's a little high
You feel that fire you've been missin'
Some days you're living
Some days you're living[Verse 1]
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don’t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'
It’s been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears:
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go

[Verse 2]
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I’ve been askin' for—
Oh, I’ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin’ for— (Trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (Trust me, darlin') problems, problems, problems

[Pre-Chorus]
So look me in the eyes (Eyes), tell me what you see (You see)
Perfect paradise (—Dise), tearin' at the seams (Seams)
I wish I could escape it (Escape), I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it (Erase), make your heart believe

[Chorus]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Bridge]
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me

[Chorus]
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
Woo!

[Verse 1]
I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
Even when I'm crying crazy
Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
Help you with your career just a little
You're 'posed to hold me down, but you're holding me back
And that's the sound of me not calling you back

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)

Fresh photos with the bomb lighting (With the bomb lighting)
New man on the Minnesota Vikings (Minnesota Vikings)
Truth hurts, needed something more exciting (Yee)
Bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay (Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You tried to break my heart?
Oh, that breaks my heart
That you thought you ever had it
No, you ain't from the start
Hey, I'm glad you're back with your bitch
I mean, who would wanna hide this?
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick
I put the sing in single
Ain't worried 'bout a ring on my finger
So you can tell your friend, "Shoot your shot" when you see him
It's okay, he already in my DMs

[Chorus]
Why men great 'til they gotta be great? ('Til they gotta be great)
Don't text me, tell it straight to my face (Tell it straight to my face)

We are, we are, we are

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

[Verse 2: Khalid]
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Run that back, Turbo

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em moanin'
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Takin' these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the mornin'
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performin'
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta where young niggas run shit
I know they hatin' on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she comin'
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't runnin'

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Yeah, every other night, another dollar gettin' made
Every other night started with a good day
I feel like a child, I got boogers in the face
Diamonds dancin' in the dial like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GonWunna not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches gettin' saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lackin', why I'm workin' on my aim
Drip too hard (Too hard), charge it to the card (To the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names
Drip too hard, caution on the floor
You gon' fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made
Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doin' all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid
Bad lil' vibe, she been on my mind
Soon as I get back, she gettin' slayed
Do this all the time, this ain't no surprise
Every other night, another movie gettin' made[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

A MAC for your facelift, rearrange your cap (Come here)
One foot in the industry and one foot in the trap
Invite that dope to my bloodline, I treat him like my strap
'Cause 'bout me he'll take a nigga's feet off the map
Big B's 'til I'm sleep, push a P, he get clapped
Two guns, that's the twin Glocks, I roger that part

I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it
I didn't wear my high heel shoes
'Cause I couldn't be taller than you
I didn't wanna lose my friends, but now it's hard to even find them
It's what you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
I thought I'd miss you

[Chorus]
But I miss me more
I miss my own beat, to my own snare drum
I miss me more
Miss my own sheets in the bed I made up
I forgot I had dreams, I forgot I had wings
Forgot who I was before I ever kissed you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you
But I miss me more (I miss me more)

[Verse 2]
I put on my old records that I hid in the back of the closet
And I turn them up to ten
And then I played them all again
I found my independence
Can't believe I ever lost it
What you wanted, ain't it?
It's what you wanted

[Pre-Chorus]
I thought I'd miss you (When it ended)
I thought it hurt me (But it didn't)
I thought I'd miss you
Yeah, I thought I'd miss you

To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

[Verse 2]
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight

Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

[Chorus]
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
"Fishin' in the Dark" needs Nitty Gritty

Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you

Knockin' boots[Verse 1: Dan + Shay]
Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?

[Pre-Chorus: Dan + Shay]
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours

If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Everything, I wanna know it all

You promised the world and I fell for it
I put you first and you adored it
Set fires to my forest
And you let it burn
Sang off-key in my chorus
'Cause it wasn't yours
I saw the signs and I ignored it
Rose-colored glasses all distorted
Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurtin'
When it wasn't yours, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

[Chorus]
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, yeah
I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
To love, love, yeah
To love, love, yeah

I gave my all and they all know it
Then you tore me down and now it's showing
In two months, you replaced us
Like it was easy
Made me think I deserved it
In the thick of healing, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We'd always go into it blindly
I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly
I needed to hate you to love me, yeah

That's how it go, big bands, I'm thumbin' shit[Verse 1]
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright"

[Verse 2]
So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

[Chorus]
And my friend said
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

[Bridge]
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

[Chorus]
"I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go"

[Outro]
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
It'll be alright[Intro: Mehki Raine]
Billie

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 1: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge: Billie Eilish & Mehki Raine]
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

[Refrain: Billie Eilish]
Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna…

[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?[Verse 1: Summer Walker, Summer Walker & Jhené Aiko]
If them bitches 'round you, better be blood
If it ain't me or your mama, shouldn't be showin' you no love
Please forgive me, I know that I'm stingy
'Cause baby, I'm gang 'bout you

That's on my mama, yeah, that's on the hood
Don't want no problems, I wish a bitch would
Try to come between us, it won't end up good
You know I love you like no one else could

Bend over backwards, acrobats for ya, yeah
I'd go up to bat for ya
Even when shit lookin' bad for ya

CashMoneyAP

[Verse 1]
You’ll never make me lose
So why you bragging on me?
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want
We came up out the street
Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never will leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, "That’s okay"
Protect my heart with that rod
I’m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars
Might have to cancel my cards
Don't come out after dark
I see she won't leave me ‘lone
She sliced the tires on my car

[Chorus]
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, no
Dirty Iyanna

[Verse 2]
Forever we get it, I'm sick of these bitches, they flow in my head, ah
We be chasing the riches, however you want it
Aim straight for the head, ah
And she know that I love her, she want me to cuff her
I think she’ll hurt me, I never will let her
I'm sending condolences inside of a letter
Still trappin' like Griselda
No, it ain't safe in these streets, all alone, ah
No, we don't play, keep that heat, we take his soul, ah
Even though when I’m wrong, I ain't never gon' lie
If I feel that I owe you, I'm gon' make it right
I'll be thuggin' and keepin' my head to the sky
Double back on a lap by myself and I cry
In the bed while I'm dreaming behind you I die
Before that can happen, I let off that fire
Trappin' and rappin', we shoot to the top
After I'm asking "Can we have a child?"
After heartbreak, I’ll cut off relations
But I be thinkin' 'bout you on the daily
Tell my niggas what up and they said that I'm crazy
Remember wit' you all them hoes, they hatin'

[Chorus]
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, no
Dirty Iyanna, Dirty Iyanna
(Iyanna, Iyanna)
Dirty Iyanna[Verse 1]
I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)

[Verse 2]
I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved

[Bridge]
I never feel so loved
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la

[Chorus]
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love? (Deep in love)
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved[Intro]
JD On Tha Track
Iceberg want a bag, bitch

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 2: Lil TJay]
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for the stain (Said he ready for the stain)
What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain (Put in pain)
Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' patty cakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)
I risked my life but it's aight 'cause God ain't let me pass away (Pass away)
Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today (Back today)
I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

[Verse 2: Drake]
I was on top when that shit meant a lot
Still on top like I'm scared of the drop
Still on top and these niggas wanna swap
Niggas wanna swap like it's Slauson or Watts
I don't wanna change 'cause I'm good where I'm at
Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at
Word to Junior, Jazzy, Baby J
Tell 'em when I die, put my money in the grave

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Couple figures, killers call and collect (Collect)
She fuck a nigga, then she on to the next (Next)
Really livin' large, she in awe with a mack
When you niggas thinkin' small in the mall with a rat (Rat)
Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)
You could DM my accountant
My per diem six figures and I'm countin'
Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me
Ross got it (Maybach Music)

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat "Realest Nigga" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, "Nah, love, I'm good, go away"
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it[Intro]

They used to tell me I'm not next, I'm like look at me now, I'm in front of them

Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

[Verse 2]
A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

[Chorus]
Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

[Post-Chorus]
And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Verse 1]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Chorus]
Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

[Verse 2]
Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

[Refrain]
I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

[Verse 3]
Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

[Chorus]
Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

[Outro: Nessly]
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)[Verse 1-Garth Brooks]
Well turn that bottle up and drink it
Crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions
Situation no conditions
Oh and memories we all need to drown
So fill your cup
Raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir

[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

[Verse 2-Blake Shelton]
'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis
It's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios to wishes wasted on them falling stars

[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

[Bridge]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some bar stool believers
Wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just going where the neon glows

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah we're just never quite belongers
Hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzing where the neon glows

[Pre-Chorus-Both]
Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are

[Chorus]
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, ya'll so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar[Intro: Lennon Stella]

Hey, hey, hey
Where do you think you're going?

I said, "I can't stay, do I have to give a reason?"
It's just me, me, me, it's what I want

[Pre-Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
So how did we get here?
Three weeks now, we've been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

[Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
Before I love you, na, na, na
I'm gonna leave you, na, na, na
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine

Fate, fate, fate
Is that what came between us?
Or did we do this on our own?

[Pre-Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
So how did we get here?
I'm asking myself why I'm so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

[Chorus: Lennon Stella & Andrew Taggart]
Before I love you, na, na, na
I'm gonna leave you, na, na, na
Before I'm someone you leave behind

[Intro]
Yeh, yeh

[Coro]
Todavía yo te quiero
Pero sé que e' un error
Porque ya tú no me quieres
Y sin ti me va mejor
Y si veo a tu mamá (Ey)
Yo le pregunto por ti
Pa' ver si ya tienes a alguien (¿Uh?)
Alguien que te haga feliz

[Verso 1]
Y aquí estoy arrebata'o
Pensando en to'a las vece' que te lo metí
Pensando en to'a las vece' que estuve pa' ti (Pa' ti, pa' ti, pa' ti)
No sé por qué diablo' me engaño (No)
Diciendo que te olvidé cuando te extraño
Solo comparto memes, ya yo no escribo nada (Damn)
Y no he borra'o tu foto, solo la puse privada

[Verso 2]
Maldito año nuevo y lo que me trajo, ey
Me botaron del trabajo por estar mirando pa' abajo
Pensando en ti siempre cabizbajo
Me veo gordito, nada que rebajo (Nah)
No sé por qué la vida me ultrajo (No)
Pensando coger un atajo
Conocí a alguien, pero no sé, nunca encajo (Ah)
Al meno' que sea' tú (Tú, tú, tú, tú)
Baby, te quiero aunque diga lo contrario
Llevo sei' mese' solitario, pero

[Puente]
Hoy salí con lo' muchacho' a beber (Jaja)
Y dije que de ti no iba hablar (No, no, no)
Son las 5, ya va amanecer (Ku-ku-ku-ku)
Si no prenden, la voy a llamar
Hoy salí con lo' muchacho' a beber (Jaja)
Y dije que de ti no iba hablar (No, no, no)
Son las 5, ya va amanecer (Ku-ku-ku-ku)
Si no prenden, la voy a llamar

Yo le pregunto por ti (Okey)
Pa' ver si ya tienes a alguien
Alguien que te haga feliz
Jajaja[Verse 1]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 2]
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

[Pre-Chorus]
My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

[Chorus]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)BLACKBEAR:

But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

[Pre-Chorus]
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin'—

[Verse 2]
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)

[Pre-Chorus]
She taught me love (Love)
She taught me patience (Patience)
How she handles pain (Pain)
That shit's amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Said thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Next)
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

[Post-Chorus]
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin'—

[Bridge]
One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got so much love (Love)
Got so much patience (Patience)
And I've learned from the pain (Pain)
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
Say I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

[Chorus]
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)

[Intro: Post Malone]
Mm, mm, mm
Mm

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Sí, ellos apuestan a que voy a caer
Sólo tengo 24, perra, pero he pasado por todo
Tengo tantos éxitos que no puedo recordarlos todos (Uh)
Mientras estoy cagando, miro las placas en la pared
Ustedes sólo siéntense y tomen su patada de vuelta
Sigan actuando como si lo hubiesen hecho, no tengo respeto
Para nadie que sea falso en la vida, ey, ey
Realmente no eres quien dices ser
Así que acelera el ritmo, no hay porqué frenar (Frenar)
Sal de mi cara, ¿puedes dejar de chupármela?
Porque mi tiempo es caro, un millón por repertorio
Compré un auto nuevo antes de que te despertases para el desayuno, sí

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente (Demasiado inteligente)
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Verso 2: Meek Mill]
Sí, ¿dónde estuviste? (¿Dónde estuviste?)
Cuando llegó el momento de trabajar y ponerle ganas
Tan sólo me río cuando los veo, míralos (Ja)
Se van cuando pierdo y aparecen de nuevo tan pronto gano (Uh)
No estabas conmigo el primer día y sé que no eres mi amigo
Así que no puedo juzgarte cuando haces mierda falsa y sólo finges
Como si realmente estuvieses conmigo, porque ser leal inicia de dentro
He visto que el amor aumenta ese amor y a la vez lo debilita
Pero no me detuvo, seguí subiendo aunque no quisiese
Ojalá cada vez que dijeran que voy a caer, ganase un millón
Jugando y todo, pero tal vez sea igual de rico que Jeff Bezos, dilo de nuevo
Nunca pierdo, voy adelantado, me quedo en ese gimnasio
Consigámoslo

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente (Demasiado inteligente)
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Verso 3: Lil Baby]
Estoy cansado de estar cansado
Esta es mi última oportunidad, no puedes enojarte, al menos lo intenté
Se supone que somos adultos, pero aún así eres infantil
Puedo subirme al avión solo, no necesito equipaje extra
Este año me convirtió en un salvaje, llevo baguettes en mi collar
Conduzco rápido, no chocaré y se supone que debo estar sobrio
Pero de una u otra manera, me sigo drogando
Se necesitará más que sólo presión para tumbarme
Intenté lo más fuerte que pude, pero en este punto está fuera de mis manos
No me quedo sin estos fajos por nada ni nadie
Ella dice que soy un perro, pero se necesita ser uno para reconocer a otro
He estado haciéndolo duro, he estado solo, no necesito amor

[Estribillo: Post Malone]
Porque nunca me han visto caer bajo presión
Nunca me vieron caer, nah, nunca
Siempre me mantengo porque soy demasiado inteligente
Nunca, nunca vendería mi alma, nah, nunca
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo
Porque he estado en el camino, he estado en el camino
Deja de actuar como si hubieses estado conmigo todo este tiempo

[Outro: Post Malone]
Mm, oh, oh no
Mm, oh, oh no
En el camino, oh[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Verse 2]
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me

[Bridge]
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her

[Chorus]
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me[Letra de "Vete"]

It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer"
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call
It's the hap-happiest season of all

There'll be parties for hosting
Marshmallows for toasting
And caroling out in the snow
There'll be scary ghost stories
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago

It's the most wonderful time of the year
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near
It's the most wonderful time of the year

When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)

Crept in the club with thirty in the stick (Thirty)
VLONE, Chrome Heart, it's still stuck on the rich
She can't talk right now 'cause she suckin' this dick
YSL slatt life, we slimy and slick (Slatt)
Got a young bull that pull up, let it spit (Bull)

Hop out a jet, hop in a Rolls
Icy Patek straight off of shows (Straight off of shows)

Stand on my money like my name Shaquille
Construction man, runnin' right through these drills
I cannot breathe 'cause there's ice on my gills
She give me brain, that's that Urkel and chill
She mixed with white, told her my name Jaleel
Uzi too rich, man, how does it feel?
Tryna be humble, man, I ain't tryna kill
They walk on my heels, my heels made of steel
That's no oil my spill, I burnt off the wheel
She ate up the deal
My baby so spoiled just like some old milk
The paint on my whip, it's already peeled
Put my dick in her gut, it's just for the guilt
Fuckin' this bitch, did that right on film
I need the beat, that's just for the stems (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Uzi Vert]
Strawberry peels, strawberry peels (Yeah)

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go[Intro]

So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason
Kick down your door, post up on your front porch, and we ain't leavin'

[Verse 1]
When my grandma died, I had to beat the odds and it wasn't easy
When Boozilla died, I almost lost my mind, broke me to pieces
We was slangin' iron for Dump and all the rest, it ain't no secret
38 across my neck, we be them boys you don't want beef with
Smokin' dro, smell it when I hit the door, 'cause I need it
I ain't the one, these pussy niggas know I be fiendin'
Hop out the car with diamonds 'round my throat, bitch, I'm beamin'
I don't think no nigga can't see me, I be paranoid while I'm leanin'

[Chorus]
Smokin' dro 'cause I need it
So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason
Kick down your door, post up on your front porch, and we ain't leavin'
I'ma leave here with what I came here for, now what you sayin'?
You don't wan' take it there, don't go there with us, nah
Walked in with a Styrofoam cup with plenty racks off in my hands
And we ain't come here for to lose, we want it all

[Verse 2]
Whole lot of racks on these VV's
I'm so slime, on this Glock, got a green beam
Got a whole lot of people that need me
Bust your head all over the right thing
I ain't got nothin' but a dub and a Black Card up inside my Ami' jeans
I just want head, can't fuck in a bed, it's just some things don't excite me
Testin' your gun inside of the backyard, let it hit, get your aim up
My youngin official, he wait in your backyard, and I call him the bang thug
Wake up in the morning, get fresh as a bitch, I'ma walk in Dior and some Margielas
And the way we gon' dump at the boy with the stick, I'ma finish him off with a four nickel
I be thinkin' 'bout Dump all over the time, this shit just don't feel right
I don't go to no club, I be takin' these drugs, ridin' and keepin' that steel tight
Every night 'fore I sleep, I think 'bout the North Side where I grew up, no ho type
Play, I put you to sleep before you could see (Bitch)
Pull up where you be and it's on sight

[Chorus]
I'ma leave here with what I came here for, now what you sayin'?
You don't wan' take it there, don't go there with us, nah
Walked in with a Styrofoam cup with plenty racks off in my hands
And we ain't come here for to lose, we want it all
Smokin' dro 'cause I need it
So I could be calm instead of dangerous when you see me
You niggas know we quick to let it blow for any reason
Kick down your door, post up on your front porch, and we ain't leavin'[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 1]
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?

[Bridge]
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no

[Chorus]
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? (Can't have you)
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?[Chorus: Jeremih & Wale]

[Verse 1: Wale]
I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine
It's no pressure for us to say that I love you for now
So fuck that cuffin' shit, I just want us be comfortable now, for real
Who you lovin'? Who you wanna pull up with?
Who don't care who you dated long as you care and you trustin'?
I'm tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
No, you not fighting alone 'cause I'm protectin' you from 'em, so chill
Life hard and ex-lovers is like scars
'Cause it stop hurtin' but never forgettin' what it was
I was a youngin, my biggest enemy was the club
With voicemails on third rings fucking me up
So I don't trust

[Chorus: Jeremih & Wale]
We've been on a tragedy for months (So I don't trust)
Why can't you agree with me for once? (And I'm tryna slow up)

Why can't you agree with me for once? Yeah
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too (Hey, shawty, look, okay)

I pull up on you then put it in with patience
I'm good, well we got it without no expectation
What good is a title when shawty been that wave? Yeah
Let me illustrate you, let my tongue repaint you
It's already waxed, have you had a brainstorm?
Everywhere a nigga take you, just know that my face good
Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow
Maxfield, let it fly, I be up in there a lot
Just to show I don't care, gon' wear it to that nigga house
We don't share our whereabouts or the gossip the hood love
Just supreme confidence, if we good that's good enough, woah, yeah

[Chorus: Jeremih]
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?

Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too

Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
To pick your body up when you down and out, let's chill
How 'bout that? Oh

Keep here taking another dri-
(¡This is the remix!)
Life has not been easy for you
You went wrong in love
There's something about him that doesn't please you anymore (Please you)
That's why she goes out and do what she does (Woh, oh)
Life is one and time will not stop
I tell you because I have seen how you get lost loving (Loving‚ oh)
Baby‚ I think time is running out
He changed you being better than her (No-no-no‚ no-oh-oh)
For women and a couple of bottles (Of bottles; no-no-no, no-oh-oh)
For friends who aren't really friends (Ah, ah; ice)
Because I know they will write to you when he leaves you
(Uah‚ uah; *everybody go to the discotek!*)

[Pre-Chorus: Anuel AA, Sech & Darell]
And now in secret and without dissimulation (That's right)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Uah-ah-ah; hah!)
Now she does what she wants when she wants (Oh-oh)
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too (Here we go again!)

[Chorus: Sech, Ozuna, Anuel AA & Darell]
When the DJ turns on the music (That's like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh)‚ and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too

[Verse 1: Anuel AA]
They left her alone, now she shows it on the disco
She always dances uncensored, for a man she doesn't cry (She doesn't cry)
Don't trust anyone, anyone (Anyone)
Today's are drink day and for the street, street (Street)
She wants to drink, she wants to dance (Dance)
And she wants to smoke and she's going to get drunk (Drunk)
She doesn't love anymore and doesn't call and doesn't claim
And I look for her in Lambo' and we end up in my bed

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]
I don't want to talk about him, let's go to the wall (Wall)
I want to see everything you know (You know)
You are asking me to put, but here it doesn't fit (Fits)
She wanted to lose her rhythm and I have the key, yeh-yeh-yeh
Do you want to see how hard am I? (Hard)
Come on, baby, it's that I'm without insurance
When I'm with you, I always feel good, yeah
You are mine, I swear you

[Chorus: Ozuna, Sech & Darell]
Baby, when the DJ turns on the music (That's like that)
She dances like never before (So that you knows)

I found her wanting to forget her ex (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
When the DJ turns on the music
She dances like never before (The Real Rondón)
Now she does what she wants when she wants
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too

[Verse 3: Ozuna]
Who wants me to take her to a private place
But to do it without anyone noticing
She told me he has a tough boyfriend
She tells me that why I arrive and don't greet
I said: "Forgive me, baby, I'm unique"
Drop the music bass, I want to see you
Sweating, baby, until dawn
There's another baby that wants to see me, you have to know
But, calm down, I'm having a good time, you too
It doesn't matter, baby, whatever who says (Whatever says)
I know that he doesn't value you (Value)
But I'm not for love now, baby
Enjoy and don't look at the time (The time)
I only fall in love with you, lady (Lady)

[Verse 4: Darell]
Woh-woh-woh, stop that shit, nigga
Now, the days are gray for her (That's right)
Because their mornings aren't happy (Hah!)
He no longer treats her as before (So that you knows)
She is single and she want to go to the disco (Ra-ta-ta-tá!)
Let me take you and ride you in the red Mercedes (That's right; red)
You going to get excited (You get excited; hah!)
For that you blush with me (Here we go again!)
While you forget everything bad he did to you
Forget it, it's been a while since he forgot about you (That's right)
I want to keep you, baby, I want to be your boyfriend (Oh-oh)
You are pretty with your beautiful body (Hah!)
And that tummy with more squares than Tetris

[Coro: Sech, Anuel AA & Darell]
When the DJ turns on the music (That’s like that)
She dances like never before (Real until death, baby; so that you knows)
And now in secret (Oh-oh), and without dissimulation (Oh-oh)
I found her wanting to forget her ex

[Verse 5: Sech]
When the DJ puts the music, music (-ic)
She enjoys it while she can (Woh, oh)
Now dance, smoke, drink, all alone
She arrives at the house and they don't tell her anything
What a good life she has (She is)
She is drunk, but asks for another bottle (Ah-ah-ah)
Is that at that time the note is high
She highlights happiness

[Pre-Chorus: Sech, Anuel AA & Darell]
And now in secret and without dissimulation (That's right)
I found her wanting to forget her ex (Uah-ah-ah; hah!; Anuel)
Now she does what she wants when she wants (Oh-oh)
And if she don't want to, you're another one who gets screwed too (Here we go again!)

[Chorus: Nicky Jam, Sech, Darell & Anuel AA]
When the DJ turns on the music (That’s like that)

Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah

[Chorus]
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"
So I call you mine

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh)
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"

[Verse 2]
Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain
You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade

[Chorus]
You said, "Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?"
And I said, "I don't even know what I'm doing tonight"
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, "I never regretted the day that I called you mine"

Can I call you mine? (Ooh, ah, ooh)

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me
Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just runnin' from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)
I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind

[Pre-Chorus]
Said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

[Chorus]
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there

Thinkin' you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why, yeah

You don't have to say just what you did (What you did)
I already know (I know)

So tell me, how's it feel? (Oh-woah)

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me

Thinkin' you could live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)[Verse 1]
I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

[Verse 2]
You said you care, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

[Bridge]
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

[Chorus]
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'[Intro: Sam Smith]

(I don't wanna, I don't wanna)
I don't wanna play no games, play no games
(I don't, I don't)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
I don't, I don't
No[Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast
Every day it's gon' rain, yeah
Made a brick through a brick, ain't whip up shit
This pure cocaine, yeah
From the streets, but I got a little sense
But I had to go coupe, no brain (Coupe, no brain)
Ain't worried 'bout you, I'ma do what I do
And I do my thing (Do my thing)

[Verse 1]
Bought her brand new shoes, told her kick rocks
Don't stand too close, diamonds kickbox
Think red means go so I don't stop
I know they wish they could catch me, but keep wishin'
You think I done turned into a fiend for these bitches
Tryna stuff as much as I can in these britches
Made your bitch fuck on my friend, it's no difference
I ain't never popped no Xan, I sip sizzurp
If I ever have to tell on the gang, I won't do it
If I put it on a song, I seen it or been through it
I can't put it in my song, I know how the feds move
Scream free all of the ahks but I ain't no FamGoon
Gave my mama ten bands, sent her to Cancún
Got the crowd goin' dumb but I ain't no damn fool
If I went in there and did it and made it, you can too
We done came a long way from broke and sharing shoes

[Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast
Every day it's gon' rain, yeah
Made a brick through a brick, ain't whip up shit
This pure cocaine, yeah

And I do my thing (Do my thing)

[Verse 2]
Got a quarter million dollars in a book bag
New Era, I'm a dope boy, no cap
I'm living my best life for real
Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work, it won't last
Get an opposite knocked off, toe tag
Ain't been home in a month, got my ho mad
They need me in the trap but I can't go back
I jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
I got M's in the bank, give a damn what they think
Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Everything you ever seen me riding in, bought it
Big dawg status, I ain't gotta sell drugs
Put my craft into rap then I took off, yeah
New G-Wagen, no key, this a push-start
I can hit the gas, make it disappear

[Chorus]

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

[Verse 1: Shawn Mendes]
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello]
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya

Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

[Verse 2: Camila Cabello with Shawn Mendes]
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la (La, la, la)
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't ya let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

[Chorus: Both, Camila Cabello & Shawn Mendes]

Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

[Outro: Both, Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
All along, I've been coming for ya (For you)
And I hope it meant something to you (Oh)
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya (Coming for you)
Coming for ya (Coming for you)
For ya
For ya (Oh, she loves it when I call)
For ya
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya[Verse 1]
Got a little southern drawl in my talk
Little pickup truck on my highway
Got a little boot stomp in my walk
Little neon lighting my Friday
Got some Tennessee in my whiskey
Raise a cup up if you with me

[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country

[Verse 2]
It's the only reason that I survived
Every breakup and every party
It's the soundtrack to my life
It runs deep in my DNA

[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country
I was raised on country

[Bridge]
(Raised on country music)
Learned a lot about living and a little 'bout love
(Raised on country music)
And you know that's something I'm so proud of

[Chorus]
I was raised on Merle, raised on Willie
Got my Honky Tonk attitude from Joe Diffie
Daddy did too, it's family tradition
If someone cranks it up, you can't help but listen
My upbringing sounds like George Strait singing
And I gotta give props to the radio
'Cause if you know me, I was raised on country

[Outro]
(Raised on country music)
Yeah, I was raised on country
(Raised on country music)
Raised on country
(Raised on country music)[Intro]
Turn you to a dancer
Yeah
Internet Money, bitch

[Chorus]
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm ’bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin’ up, now they say they want some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah

[Verse]
I got red, I got blue, what you want?
The Chanel or Balenciaga, Louis and Vuitton
She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I hit Milan
I needed me a die or rider, I need me the one
I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
I want all the diamonds, I want that shit to weigh a ton
The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
But them niggas don't know me, they just know the place I'm from
I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face
They all up in my inbox, so I know they want a taste
I know they want my downfall, lil' nigga, are you laced?

[Chorus]
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I’m ’bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I’m gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want  some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah
I got black, I got white, what you want?
Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
I know I'm ’bout to blow, I ain't dumb
They try to take my flow, I take they ass for ransom
I know that I'm gone
They see me blowin' up, now they say they want  some
I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah[Verse 1: Brantley Gilbert]
I can't go for a ride to clear my head
'Cause everything I pass puts you back in it
Yeah, we're done, movin' on
But you can't be too far gone

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

[Verse 2: Lindsay Eli, Lindsay Eli & Brantley Gilbert]
Oh, we said this goodbye was the last
I guess I could leave, I could run from the past
And from us, and from you
But this is where I belong, this is my home too

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
What happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

[Bridge: Brantley Gilbert, Lindsay Eli, Both]
Yeah, I'm still here, yeah
And every time I see that little white Jeep
Yeah, that hand-me-down Ford pullin' down your street
You wonder if somebody's in my seat
If you're movin' on or you're stuck like me
What happens in a small town
Stays in a small town, oh yeah

[Chorus: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
What happens in a small town stays in a small town
Every back road we've ever gone down
Friday night bleachers, Sunday pews
Ain't a county line mile without a memory of you
Every whisper, every room I walk in
Every time the bartender fills it up again
Everybody knows why I'm here, and you ain't around
(You ain't around)
'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town

[Outro: Brantley Gilbert & Lindsay Eli]
It stays in a small town
It stays in a small town
And I'm still here
(What happens in a small town)
I'm still here
(Stays in a small town)
I'm still here
Yeah, I'm still here
I'm still here[Verse 1]
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Verse 2]
We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

[Interlude]
(This is God's country)
God's country

[Bridge]
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country[Verse 1]
I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learned to say "sir" and "ma'am", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
I wish Monday mornings felt just like Friday nights

[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

[Verse 2]
I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet could happen every day

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
I wish Country music still got played on Country radio

[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

Never died

[Bridge]
And I wish good dogs never got grey and old
I wish farms never got sold

[Chorus]
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
I wish high school home teams never lost

And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

I wish grandpas never died[Intro]
No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Interlude]
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life

[Verse 2]
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Bad, bad news
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Bridge]
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto

[Interlude]
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
Pretty cool... right?

[Chorus]
You are my strange addiction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction

[Outro]
Did you like it? Did you like that?
Um, which part?[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, "I miss you"
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, "Of course"
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt[Chorus]
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color, like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

[Verse 1]
I drive down open roads so slow
Here comes a train, I'll let it go
Ain't got nobody on my phone
Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)
Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)
Too good at welcoming amends
It's been a while since I've heard her say
That we were more than friends (Oh)
Oh, I, I-I-I, know a lot is going on
But girl, please tell me
And I'll let you be
Are you still with me or not?

[Chorus]
She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color, like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start

[Refrain]
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

[Verse 2]
I'm by the garden with the carpenter bees
Like I'm Bob Ross-in' with a Harden beard
Taking it all in like I got no issues in my nature
Primroses blooming in the night
Birds wanna take me on a flight
Appreciating my land 'fore it turns into a glacier
Chasers are of no good use
This taste will be long endured
Why'd you have to go so soon?
I thought this was as good as new

[Interlude]
She put yellow hearts around my name
I thought they were all just the same
To you, what do they really mean?
Have you only been playing games?

[Chorus]
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
Her favorite color, like the stars (Like the stars)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (She put yellow hearts around my name)
I said she was a work of art (I thought they were all just the same)
I didn't listen very hard (To you, what do they really mean?)
When she told me she was crazy from the start (Have you only been playing games?)

[Outro]
Have you only been playing games?

I'm losing my self control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Verse 2]
I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

[Bridge]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

[Chorus]
Two years, and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

[Post-Chorus]
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(And I'll have to get over you all over again)
Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
(Over you all over again)

[Outro]
Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over[Intro]

(You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around)
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
(You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?)
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
(I got so high the other night, I swear to God I felt my feet lift the ground)
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears

Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no

You look at me (Look at me)
With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see
You push right through me (Push right through me)
It's gettin' real
You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel
And I can't conceal

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running

[Chorus]
They say I may be making a mistake
I woulda followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard

[Bridge]
Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I woulda followed all the way to the graveyard[Intro]
Get to roll no...
Ayy, I'm in the studio, bro
Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

[Verse 1]
I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

[Chorus]
I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind (I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him it's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind (Bitch, I got murder on my mind)
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(I got murder on my mind)

[Verse 3]
Bite like tarantula, bitch, I'm an animal
Melly's a savage, no he not no amateur
Bad bitch named Angela, fucked her on camera
Bitch I'm a murderer (Yeah, yeah)
I might just kill the boy, don't wanna kill the boy
Bake him up, say he want beef, we gon' grill the boy
(Grill the boy, we gonna grill the boy)
I'm bleeding so good, I might dip his ass in it and spill the boy
Haha, murder on my mind, whoa, whoa
I got murder on my mind (On my mind)
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind, huh

[Chorus]
Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind
But I can't let 'em do it, I got murder on my mind
Bitch, I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind
I got murder on my mind, I got murder on my mind
(Murder on my mind)

[Outro]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Young Nigga World, bitch
Whoa-oh-oh-oh[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover[Intro]
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah

I put her in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I seen you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dojo like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it
Goin' up, I ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she's screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

Grab a cop gun kinda crazy
She's poison but tasty
Yeah, people say, "Run, don't walk away"
'Cause she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin', "I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

[Verse 2]
See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions
She'll kiss your neck with no emotion
When she's mean, you know you love it
She tastes so sweet, don't sugarcoat it"

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no
You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be saying, "No (No, no, no), no (No)"

You're tellin' me that I'm insane
Boy, don't pretend that you don't love the pain

You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 2: Jon Pardi]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus: Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation

[Chorus: Jon Pardi]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Jon Pardi & Both]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
Heartbroken (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix[Intro]

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

[Verse Reprise]
Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go

Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Move on, we're not seventeen
I'm not who I used to be
You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now

[Chorus]
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away

[Verse 1]
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Verse 2]
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

[Chorus]
Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

[Bridge]
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless[Intro]
New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
"Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses"
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, "What's happenin'?"
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah

That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, "No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it"
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

[Verse 2]
(Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)
Oh, oh, baby

[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh-hoo
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)
But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)
This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

[Outro]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)
A man under cover but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Special...
Someone...[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just coming back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch[Intro]
Enviyon on the mix
No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Outro]
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me[Intro]
I'd rather keep it real with ya
Real hot girl shit, ah

Helluva made this beat, baby
Huh

[Chorus]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway

You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
Why you wanna play with me? You know I'm undefeated
A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect, well, treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me keep it real, but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come a-lookin' for you 'til I find ya
You really want me to whoop the ho that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch, you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lying, man, that's fraud, bruh
Man, you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax
You know that you gon' hate me if I get to playin' get-back
I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy, I been that
You tryna make me somethin' that I ain't, and I ain't with that (Nah)

'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right

[Verse 2]
I got my mind on gettin' paid, we ain't spoke in some days
He probably thinkin' I'm in pain, but I'm really on game
Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin', can't depend on a "probably"
And that's fucked up, 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories, one-sided
I ain't perfect and I try to fix the shit that ain't workin'
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerkin'
Since you wanna test them waters, might as well jump in with both feet
If you leave me and you see me, better act like you don't know me
If you think this shit get better with another bitch, go get her (Go and get her)
When you realize she ain't got you like I got you, I can't help ya

[Chorus]
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right
I'd rather be your B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya)
'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway
You know you can't control me, baby, you need a real one in your life
Them bitches ain't gon' give it to you right

I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs

So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah

[Verse 1: Lauv]
Party, trying my best to meet somebody
But everybody around me is falling in love to our song
I, I, oh I, yeah
Hate it, taking a shot 'cause I can't take it
But I don't think that they make anything that strong, so I hold on
I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
Strangers, killing my lonely nights with strangers
And when they leave, I go back to our song, I hold on

Hurts like heaven, lost in the sound
Buzzcut Season like you're still around
Can't unmiss you, but I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

[Chorus: Lauv & Troye Sivan]
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home
Wanna go home, woah
I'm so tired of love songs, tired of love songs (Someone take me home)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home ('Cause I can't be alone)
Wanna go home, woah
So tired of love songs, tired of love songs ('Cause I'm so tired)
Tired of love songs, tired of love
Just wanna go home, wanna go home (Tired of love, tired of love)
Wanna go home, woah (Tired of love)[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer[Verse 1]
Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, we're not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it

[Verse 2]
Girl, I know that you've been waiting and talking to your friends
Wondering if and wondering where and wondering when
Well, I've been waiting too, holding on to this ring
For the right words to say, for the right time and place, for me to get on one knee

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, can't you see forever?
Take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world here together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, well this is it
This is it

[Bridge]
Now you're walking down the aisle
And I can't help but smile

[Chorus]
This is it, this is now, it's what I've been talking 'bout
Looking out, I can see forever
So take my hand, just take it in (Take it in)
This is a moment we won't forget (Won't forget)
On top of the world, here, together
Surrounded by our family and our friends
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss
This is it
Yeah, this is it[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings

Pose like a trophy when Naomis walk in
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin

Melanin too dark to throw her shade
She minds her business and wines her waist
Gold like 24k, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé]
Tonight I might fall in love, dependin' on how you hold me

There's complexities in complexion
But your skin, it glow like diamonds
Dig me like the earth, you be giving birth
Took everything in life, baby, know your worth
I love everything about you, from your nappy curls
To every single curve, your body natural
Same skin that was broken be the same skin takin' over
Most things out of focus, view
But when you're in the room, they notice you (Notice you)
'Cause you're beautiful
Yeah, you're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Them men, them gon' fall in love with you and all of your glory
Your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story
Keep dancin', they can't control you
They watchin', they all adore you
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told you

Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

[Chorus]
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town

One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

[Verse 2]
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)

You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow

One by one by

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you

Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

[Verse 1]
I've been broken, yeah, I know how it feels
To be open and then find out your love isn't real

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you

Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

I know I'm not the best at choosing lovers (Oh)
We both know my past speaks for itself (For itself)
If you don't think that we're right for each other (Baby, no)
Then please don't let history repeat itself
'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah
There's nothing else I want
'Cause I want you, yeah, I want you, yeah
And you're the only thing I want

Don't break me again, I am delicate
Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

[Outro]
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you

You, you, 'cause I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
Baby, I want you, baby, I want you
You, you[Verse 1]
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume is floating down the stairs
You're fixing up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time
It's nothin' new

[Pre-Chorus]
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Verse 2]
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words, out of my mouth without even tryin'

[Chorus]
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you standin' there in that dress
What it's doin' to me ain't a secret
'Cause watching you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Bridge]
Yeah, baby, mmm
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes

[Chorus]
I'm speechless
You standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Oh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless

[Outro]
Oh, you know it, baby
Mmm[Intro]
Oh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Verse]
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

[Bridge]
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

[Chorus]
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

[Outro]
Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down[Intro]

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 2: Post Malone]
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (No way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? ('Gether)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? (Brrr-brrr)
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this (Fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Post Malone & Justin Bieber]
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Verse 3: Clever]
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

[Outro: Clever]
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around[Verse 1: 42 Dugg]
Got a lotta new flames, still need them blue
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two

Peace to my grandma, I can still see my guys
Turned his back, must've felt let down
Heard I'm down seven hundred, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, I used to be a twerp, bitch, a vet now

Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kissin'
Bitches ain't shit, word to my niggas

Bitch really wanna get hired
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson

Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fightin'
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt, then I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 4: 42 Dugg]
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building
Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Tev, this shit was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my niggas
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5 just beat his murder
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah[Verse 1]
I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh, I can taste it on the tip of my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang on to anything you can hold

[Chorus]
It's a long way down
To where I wanna go

To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

[Verse 2]
Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well, I love you from the morning 'til the setting sun, yeah

Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow

Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim

Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake

Hit that smoke and I'm blackin' (Blackin')

You don't want no complication, no
I don't want no side information (I don't want no side information)
I just need to know what's happening
'cause I'm for real (For real)

[Intro: Bad Bunny & Jhay Cortez]
(Se hace la que no me conoce
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12)
(Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh; ¿me sigue'?)
Nunca se deja ver (Nunca se deja ver; ¡no!)
Lo sabe disimular (Lo sabe disimular)
Tiene lo suyo y le va bien
Pero de noche conmigo le gusta portarse mal (Wuh-huh!)
Llega y lo que quiere es pecar, eh (Ey)
Está puesta pa’ bellaquear, eh (La presión)
Yo no la paro, y a veces mira raro y (¡Rrra!)

[Coro: Jhay Cortez & Bad Bunny]
Se hace la que no me conoce (La que no me conoce; no, no, no)
Pero en mi cama se volvió un vicio como la 5-12 (Como la 5-12)
Me la como entera y nadie se entera

To’as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga (Siga)

To'as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny]
Huh-huh, eh
Si las miradas mataran, la tuya me hizo el amor (Eh)
Se ve que tú estás a vapor
Ella mata con traje y cuando se viste sport (Wuh)
Tiene el booty XL, pero usa los pantie' small
Una' pa’l no aguntan presión y la tienen bloqueá’, eh
Un pa'l de psycho, stalkeá’ (Eh)
No brega en la calle, pero está baqueá' (No)
La baby está muy dura, pa' mí que está hackeá' (Eh), eh
Chiquitita pero grandota, en la uni buenas nota’, eh
Niña buena, se le nota (Eh, eh), pero le explota la nota y (Ey)

To'as solteras, siempre la velan pa' que ella siga
(Pa' que ella siga; ¿me sigue'?)

[Verso 2: J Balvin]
Me llama pa' que yo la pruebe y (Yah)
Cuando yo la toco, eso llueve ahí (-ve ahí)
Ella se vistió y yo la desvestí (Que sí)
Nunca dice: "No", siempre dice: "Sí" (Wuh)
Cuando quiere bailar, el dembow la azota (¿Qué?)
Ella se pone loca
Ella lo que quiere es peinarse (Wuh), y arreglarse (Wuh)
Llega a la disco a soltarse (Ah)
Que si me conoce, dice: "No", pero sabe bien que sí
Ella lo mezcla con alcohol, como cuando yo le di
En toda' las poses, preguntan y dice: "No sé"
De contacto tiene "José", y siempre después de las 11 o 12

[Verso 3: Jhay Cortez]
Tira pa' que yo la pruebe
Se pone olorosa y me gusta como huele (Como huele)
Instagram privado pa' que nadie la vele
Se puso bonita porque sabe que hoy se bebe
A portarse mal pa' sentirse bien (Bien)
No quería fumar pero le dio al pen (Sí)
Una Barbie, pero no busca un Ken (No)
Siempre le llego cuando dice: "Ven"
Pa' portarse mal se viste bien (Bien)
Dice la verdad y a vece' miente también
Apaga las notificacione' en el cel
Ella tiene lo suyo, pero hoy quiere joder

Y yo le di por el expre-so
Le llené el cuello de be-so'
Le hice tiempo como un pre-so

Take you down

Take you down
What I'm about
Take you down
I really wanna take you down
And show you what I'm about
Can I take you down?
Your body, body, oh
Your body, body up and down

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I'm gonna put you in seven positions for seventy minutes, you get it, babe
You got a lot on your mind, and I wanna ease it up and lick it and slip it in
You do a light scream on that ice cream when I scoop it and dip it in
Unzippin' the tight jeans and that feminine hygiene is magnificent
Tryna show you, girl, I'm different
I get to lickin', and stickin', and lickin', and stickin' it
'Til the pussy get too wet and it's drippin'
And splittin' both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want it, then you'll end up sittin' all over my bottom lip, baby
The feelin' of fuckin' you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em, baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it, baby
But still you do it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby
Like what's a goon to a goblin, baby?
That pussy hotter than the summer June in Metropolis, baby
No hidin' it, baby
She know what it is when I come around
Let me take you down

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tory Lanez]
It ain't my first time, but baby girl, let's get it in, yeah (Let it's get in, yeah)
Bump and grind, already know (Already know, oh)
I wanna take you down again (Take you down again)
Hit that rewind button, oh-oh (Oh-oh)

Now let me take you down
Really wanna take you down, you down, you down (Ooh)
Take you down (I do), right now (Right now)
You know I know how (Oh-woah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Come put that shit all on top of me, baby
I'm the one they feelin', so they copy me, baby
Got it copywritten, that's my property, baby
And the way that she whip it, it's drivin' me crazy (Huh)
Think I've been hittin' the lottery, baby
Buy you a Wraith, I'ma give you my safe
Put you in apartments, you parkin' in places
Yeah, that's the real-life Monopoly, baby
We got all night to get it right, babe
So let me play
We got our whole damn life, baby
So here we are, all alone in this room
Girl, you know what I came to do
Know you got me on your radio playin', old school CB
It's just me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Tory Lanez]
It ain't my first time, but baby girl, let's get it in, yeah (Oh-woah, we don't need)
Bump and grind, already know (You already know)
I wanna take you down again (Oh-woah)
Hit that rewind button, oh-oh

Now let me take you down
Really wanna take you down (I wanna take you down), you down, you down (Ooh)
Take you down, right now (Right now)
You know I know how (I know how), ooh

Ooh, yeah, love
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (You know I)
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe (Know I)

I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (Ooh, woah)
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe (Oh)
And promise when you promise, keep them promises (Woah)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (If you feel me, let me hear you say)
I promise not to give it to nobody, babe (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And promise you won't give it to nobody, babe (Ooh)
And promise when you promise, keep them promises (Woah)

De Instagram te borré, de mi vida te borré (¡Plo!)

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny]
Y ahora quiere' volver (¡Nah!)
Nah, tú lo que quiere' e' joder (¡Wuh!)

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verso 2: J Balvin]
Intentas hacerlo todo para que yo vuelva
Las cosas no son iguales, ¿para qué insistir?
Evita molestias y tu tiempo no pierdas
Conmigo no encuentras nada
A escondidas vives chequeando las fotos
Investigando mi perfil
No lo niegues, bien te conozco

[Puente: J Balvin]
Todo lo que tú hiciste conmigo
Quiere' repetirlo
Anda buscando más
Y a mí eso me da igual
Todo lo que tú hiciste conmigo
Quiere' repetirlo
Anda buscando más
Y a mí eso me da igual

Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now, the jingle hop has begun

[Verse 2]
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

[Bridge]
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

[Chorus]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

[Outro]
Chasing you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing you[Chorus]

There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright

[Verso 1: Post Malone]
Kurt y yo sentimos lo mismo, demasiado placer es dolor
Mi chica me escupe en vano, todo lo que hago es quejarme
Necesita que algo cambie, necesito salir del margen
Así que a la mierda todo esta noche
Y no me digas que me calle
Cuando sabes que hablas demasiado
Pero no tienes una mierda que decir (Decir)

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Verso 2: Post Malone]
Los dos estamos actuando como locos, pero somos demasiado tercos para cambiar
Ahora estoy bebiendo otra vez, con 80 grados de alcohol en mis venas
Y mis dedos se tiñeron, mirando por encima del borde
No me jodas esta noche
Dijiste que necesitabas este corazón, ahora lo tienes (Lo tienes)
Resulta que no era lo que querías (Querías)
Y como no lo soltabamos, lo perdimos
Ahora soy un desahuciado

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado (Salvado, también)
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Verso 3: Young Thug]
Te quiero fuera de mi vida
Te quiero de vuelta aquí esta noche
Estoy tratando de cortarte, sin cuchillo
Quiero rebanarte y cortarte en cubitos
Mi argumento es posesivo, te hizo preciso
¿No puedes apagar el televisor? Estoy viendo la pelea
Inundé el garaje, de diamante azul, sin tiburón
Eres una muñeca de Barbie, como Nicki Minaj
No necesitas una llave para conducir, tu coche tiene el cargador
Solo quiero ver el lado, ese que no es molestado (Sí)
Y no quiero que nunca salgas afuera (Afuera)
Prometo que si te engañan, mis colegas aparecerán (Aparecerán)
La estoy follando, y el autobús del tour sigue andando (Andando)
Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí

[Coro: Post Malone]
Quiero que salgas de mi cabeza (Cabeza)
Quiero que salgas de mi habitación esta noche (Habitación)
No hay manera de que pueda salvarte (Salvarte)
Porque yo también necesito ser salvado (Salvado, también)
No soy bueno con las despedidas

[Outro: Post Malone & Young Thug]
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
(Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós, adiós)
No soy bueno con las despedidas
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)
Adiós, adiós, adiós (Adiós, adiós)

[Verse 1: Blueface]
Ooh, look at all these hoes I'm attractin'
She blew me, so I blew a bag on her fashion
Sexual relations with no strings attached (No strings attached)
I just got her new Fendis, with no strings attached (Bop, bop)
Baby gave me mad face without the attitude (No attitude)
She gon' do it all for Chanel and Jimmy Choo (Jimmy Choo)
I'm the type to spend a bag on a handbag (On a handbag)
Doesn't mean that we involved, she just gotta brag
You can't make me cum, then you can't come back (Don't come back)
I can crack a bitch, and I ain't got no fuckin' crack
I just want some mouth without the conversation (Yeah, aight)
This ain't no waitin' room, baby, ain't no room for waitin'
I can't even tell the time, this AP decoration
Baby, make it clap like a celebration

Long legs, cut off jeans
Pulling me in like a magnet
Your eyes locked on me
I knew right then I had to have you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Right here in the middle of the floor
Of this hole-in-the-wall on a back street
I knew I had to get close to you

[Chorus]
Girl what's your name, what you drinking?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

[Verse 2]
Soft hands touching on me
Lighting me up like a bonfire
Your lips are making me think
This is gonna be an all-nighter

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Right here in the middle of the crowd
You're the center of the world on a barstool
Oh yeah I had to get close to you, girl

[Chorus]
Girl what's your name, what you drinking?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

[Bridge]
Yeah
We'll be sneaking on out to your car, car, car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark, dark, dark

[Chorus]
Girl what's your name, what you drinking?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

[Outro]
You're gonna make me want to
You're gonna make me want to, girl
You're gonna make me want to, want to
I want you[Chorus]
I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

[Verse 1]
Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on, dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard, but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

[Pre-Chorus]
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

[Chorus]
I do my hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
(Feeling good as hell)
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

[Verse 2]
Woo, girl, need to kick off your shoes
Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause he don't love you anymore
So walk your fine ass out the door

[Chorus]
And do your hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (Show it off tonight)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (And we gon' be alright)
Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell)

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm, yeah, alright
Listen, if he don't love you anymore
Then walk your fine ass out the door

[Chorus]

Hair toss, check my nails
Baby, how you feelin'? (Feelin' good as hell) (Show it off tonight)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh-huh-uh
Lovin' the shit out you, fuckin' the shit out you
For seven days straight, and now I can't even live without you
And if we ever broke up, I won't have a kid without you
You forever in my heart, I won't forget about you
I be crushin' you on Monday like it's Wednesday
You pressed about that nigga, what your friends say?
Oh, G63 is what your Benz say
I'm so happy you ain't listen to your friends, babe
You can tell me how you want it, how you need it, I don't mind
Need you right here by my side, 'cause out of sight is out of mind
And out of spite you hit decline, but I was hype
I hit your line a few more times than you hit back I'm gon' respond

[Chorus: Ella Mai & Meek Mill]

Uh, yeah
You be throwin' that shit back like it's a Thursday
I be treatin' you like everyday your birthday
Them hoes ain't fuckin' with you on your worst day
I got you on a new level like what Ferg say
When you fell down, I pick you up
Put on your crown, and lift you up
I put a rock all on your finger, so much ice could push a puck
Heard they feelings 'bout you, baby, tell them hoes I wish 'em luck
Talkin' relationship goals, this could be us, yuh
24/7, what's the 411?
When you see me kneel like Kaepernick, call a reverend
See, I got a milli' in a stash for a weddin'
If you ready, let me know, 'cause it's whatever

[Bridge: Ella Mai]
But I know you in the worst way
Yeah, our anniversary
'Bout to suit up on my birthday
'Cause I know they keep you thirsty
Ain't no playin', this is us
Boy, be gentle, ain't no rush
365, you're the only one I trust
No, I can't get enough
And all my ladies, if you feel me, help me sing it out
Yeah, yeah

What I found out-
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
Yeah
Yeah
Uh
Back up on my b—
Done dealing with you
Yeah

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
It seem like I give so much and don't get nothin' back
I really thought it was love but you're so fuckin' whack
Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that
I can't get caught up in lust, so now I'm—, yeah
Flexin' on my exes, in my model X
Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the move
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose
I am on my own now, I am in control now
I need you to go now, I can fix my own crown

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)

[Verse 2: H.E.R]
Seen you with your ex, I see you still about your old ways
Might just see him for the weekend, you say that's a cold play
I be feelin' triggered, I don't know how to let it go
Really you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional, hey (Hey)
Puttin' me through it
He's the only thing that's been gettin' me through it
He be comin' through with it
And I hope you cool with it
I just met your roommate, put him on my to-do list
Doin' me
Back up on some new shit, everything in between
I'm out here, I'm gettin' stupid
I'm done bein' exclusive and—
You know the truth is that these niggas is useless
I'm back on my—

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko, H.E.R., Both]
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Out here actin' foolish, like I'm seventeen

I just seen your new bitch, it boost my self-esteem (Oh babe)
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)

[Outro: Jhené Aiko & H.E.R.]

Oh-oh-oh
Done dealing with you, so I'm back[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feelin' heat in December when you're 'round me

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (About you), about you (About you)
And you're makin' the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
Don't complicate it (Yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember (Yeah) all of the nights
I don't remember when you're 'round me (Oh, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
I've been dancin' on top of cars and stumblin' out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

[Chorus: Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I'm a sucker for you
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]

I'm a sucker for you[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's gotta past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Bridge]
When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me

[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at, hah

[Verse 2]
Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch, don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah

[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at[Verse 1]
Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

[Verse 2]
Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?

[Bridge]
Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

[Chorus]
There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
Whatd'you say we make it-
Make it true?
Whatd'you say we make it true?
Come on over here
Let's really give them something to talk about, baby
There's a rumor going round[Intro]
Man, what? (Haha)
This shit funny, one sec
Oof, this Hennessy strong as fuck, boy

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, "You loved me first" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, "Never let your woman know when you're insecure"
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
"Flex on a ho every time they're insecure"
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past (Past)
I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Bridge]
You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you

[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave, from my past
I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it[Intro: Blueface & French Montana]

"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Verse 2]
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
(Yay)

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

[Bridge]
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She's like a picture from an airplane window
It's always sunny up above the clouds
She's got a mouth full of innuendo
But she makes it sound innocent somehow
Those hungry eyes can't be denied
Take me to church, show me the light
Straight masterpiece, way out of my league
Yeah but I'm gonna hold her like a trophy tonight

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't gonna sit here and overthink it
I got a tiger by the tail
I'll just smile when she sinks her teeth in
She'll leave a scar and a story to tell

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Bridge]
Hey hey, hey hey
She's gonna sting me but damn it I want it
Hey hey, hey hey
Honey's so sweet in that moment

[Chorus]
She's decoratin' my car
Soon she'll be breakin' my heart
She's too Wild Horses to be all mine
I'll be your Beast of Burden on borrowed time
She's gonna rip off any kind of label
She's into leavin' those strings untied
Keepin' it tax free, under the table
She might only be mine tonight
But that's alright, that's okay
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away
That's alright, might hurt, but hey
She's gonna be one hell of a one that got away

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
I fuck you from the back and leave you turnin' (Turnin')
The type to make you feel like I'm so worth it (Worth it)
Blame my ex, that bitch, she did me dirty (Did me dirty)
Had me fall in love and then she curved me
(on God, swear to God, I don't wanna leave you, no)
New Louboutin, you would think I’m bleedin’ from my toes
Dick all inside of you, make you freeze, make you pose
I want you to get up on your knees and your toes
I see one of my enemies, they gon' freeze like they cold
I swear I ain’t no killer, but test me if you want
You don't want my adrenaline rushin', leave me alone (Leave me alone)
So much shit up on my mind, I can't think, yeah
All my niggas rock designer like they scream (Grrat)

[Verse 3: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Like, where these niggas at? Ayy, where these niggas at?
I'ma pull up in the big body with the fuckin' MAC
If the opps try to turn my song off, run it back
Used to have the pack in my long johns, now I rap

[Verse 4: 6ix9ine]
If a nigga wanna act out, got the MAC out
I ain't got no fuckin' back-up, that's a man down
I ain't got the fuckin' forty, knock his teeth out
Spin back with the Ruger, air the block out

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Swervin' (Swervin')

Say my name in your song and it's lit, yeah
Been waiting for a nigga like this, yeah
We got London On Da Track[Verse 1]
Don't even want the attention
But yeah, that's all that she's getting
Her song is on and she's spinning around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racing like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

[Pre-Chorus]
And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Verse 2]
It's like I heard angels singing
Like she came down from the ceiling
When she walked in here this evening, I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feeling
Like there's a fire in this building, so hot

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

[Bridge]
Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

[Chorus]
Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?

We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go

And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, but we're running in circles

Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget
I'ma take you from this party, we might go and have some sex
Or we do that later on, now we lit like cigarettes

I thought you would stay with me
I'm yours and you're mine, I envy
So what I'm gon' do?
I don't have no clue, ain't no me without you

Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought (Cardi)

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
Look, gunshot, gunshot
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped
Now you know how I get, every day, a foreign whip
Rather see you in a hearse than see you with some other bitch
Huh?

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Oh, here we go, please let me know
Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought

[Outro: Lil Nas X]
I thought you would stay with me

Father, I stretch
Stretch my hands to You

[Verse]
Lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
People really know you, push your buttons like typewrite
This is like a movie, but it's really very lifelike
Every single night, right, every single fight, right?
I was looking at the 'Gram and I don't even like likes
I was screamin' at my dad, he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
I was screamin' at the referee just like Mike
Lookin' for a bright light, Sigel, what your life like
Riding on a white bike, feeling like Excitebike (Stretch my hands to You)
Pressin' on the gas, supernova for a night light
Screamin' at my dad and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like"
But nobody never tell you when you're being like Christ
Only ever seein' me only when they needin' me
Like if Tyler Perry made a movie for BET
Searchin' for a deity, now you wanna see it free
Now you wanna see if we, let's just see if three apiece
Tell me what your life like, turn it down, a bright light
Drivin' with my dad, and he told me, "It ain't Christ-like" (Stretch my hands to You)
I'm just tryna find, l've been lookin' for a new way
I'm just really tryin' not to really do the fool way
I don't have a cool way, bein' on my best, though
Block 'em on the text though, nothin' else next though
Not another word, letter, picture, or a decimal (Father, I stretch)
Wrestlin' with God, I don't really want to wrestle
Man, it's really lifelike, everything in my life (Stretch my hands to You)
Arguing with my dad, and he said, "It ain't Christ-like"

[Outro]
Man
You know, it's like
Somebody only close who can get you, like, off your
I be on my
I woke up this morning, I said my prayers
I'm all doing good, I tried to talk to my dad (Stretch my hands to You)
Give him some advice, he starts spazzin' on me
I start spazzin' back, He said "That ain't Christ-like"
I said, "Ahhh"[Intro: Cardi B]

Where's the guy in the steel toes covered in dirt?
Just a rock n' roll T-shirt, headed to work
With a pack of Red Man in his pocket
He's kind of red, man, but he's rockin'
Wears a beat up Tele' and a Marshall stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six pack
Where's the good ol' boys and the good ol' days?
Straight up gettin' sideways

[Chorus]
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

[Verse 2]
Where's the chick wearin' blue jeans a little too tight?
Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes
Getting picked up in a pickup
And kickin' it with guys like us

[Chorus]
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

[Bridge]
Sun comes up and sun goes down, yeah
Everything good comes back around
We back, we back

We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back (We back, we back in the speakers)
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back (We back, we back
It's probably true what my mama said)

Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Bridge: Luke Combs, Brooks & Dunn]
C'mon
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young so whatcha say we shotgun one?
Hell we'll shoot one with you Luke, come on Ronnie

[Chorus: Brooks & Dunn, Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
About half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man, I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hit me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
Yeah, 5-4-3-2-1 too many

Come on, that’s a ******* country song right there[Chorus]
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'

Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

I'll make sure I leave the door unlocked
Now I'm on the way, swear I won't be late
I'll be there by five o'clock

Oh, you've been dreamin' 'bout it
And I'm what you want
So stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
Can we just talk? (Oh) Can we just talk?
Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts

All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

Yeah, every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge
I left behind me up in smoke
Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while

Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

Suicidal
Your love is suicidal
Lately I've been feeling suicidal
Your love is suicidal

[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed
I gave you all my ecstasy
I know you'll be the death of me (Keep it Z3N)
Left lipstick on my Hennessy
Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be

[Chorus: YNW Melly & Juice WRLD, Both]
Your love is suicidal
For me, your love is suicidal
To me, your love is suicidal (Ooh)
To me, your love is suicidal

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Sippin' on this Hennessy, once you were my friend
Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins
I thought that we were meant to be
'Til you struck out like one, two, three
The thought of you was heavenly
At first, now it's where Hell will be
Oh, I've been balling on my own, shawty, sipping fours
Pour it in a twenty, make it strong, shawty, gripping poles
Catch your new lil' nigga and it's on, shawty, I'ma blow
Hit him with the Ruger and it's too silent, make it go (Shh)
Do him bogus, make his heart hurt, that's what love is
You're leaving me for him, are you on drugs, bitch?
I know you are, 'cause you're never Perc'-less, so perfect

[Pre-Chorus: YNW Melly]
I thought that we were meant to be
You took my heart and made it bleed

Felt like you took my soul from me
You gave me all your ecstasy
I thought that we were meant to be

Huh, ooh, I'm pissin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh
Then flush it in the past, then fornicate with cash
I'm tryna heal the gash, you up and made a slash, then left (Ooh)
You tell your friends I was the worst even though it isn't true
You actin' out your body, baby, I know it isn't you
Seen you feel ridiculed when you played me like a fool[Intro]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!
I cannot do the snowflake[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
I've been contemplatin', meditatin'
Should've waited, should've never dated
You seem irritated, baby, why you never say it?
Isn't this worth saving?
I can feel you fading off
We're not gonna make it long
Guess you cannot take it
Guess it's worth sayin'

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
It's none of your concern anymore
None of your concern
Is it even worth it at all?
Is it even worth it?
Is it gonna work anymore?
Is it gonna work?
Am I being heard anymore?
Am I being heard? Nah, yeah

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
I've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems you movin' on from me
Caught you on the scene with little miss thing, and trust me, she really don't want beef
That's besides the point, I'm disappointed as a homie, what is it you see?
I want better for you movin' forward, what's better for you than me?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Ty Dolla $ign]
Guess that's none of my concern anymore
None of my concern (It ain't worth anymore)
It ain't even worth it no more
It ain't even worth it (It ain't worth it)
It don't even hurt anymore
It don't even hurt (It don't, don't hurt)
It ain't gonna work anymore
It ain't gonna work, yeah

[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
You've been hearin' things and seeing things and so it seems I'm movin' on my own
The audacity to question me, like you ain't leave me out here on my own
I was traumatized and suicidal, I'm sick and tired, I am not to blame
Once I felt a way, but not today, I'm not afraid, now I can say
Get your bitch ass off of my phone, please leave me alone
I am not your girl anymore, you need to watch your tone
Don't worry about who it is I'm fuckin' or who I am lovin', just know that it is not you
This isn't up for discussion, I wish you good luck, man
When it comes to you

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Ty Dolla $ign]
It's none of my concern anymore
None of my concern (Anymore, anymore)
I know that I'm deserving of more
I know what I deserve (Anymore, anymore)
Not scared to be alone anymore
Not scared to be alone (Anymore, no, no)
It don't even hurt anymore
It don't even hurt

[Bridge: Jhené Aiko & Ty Dolla $ign]
You've been on some bullshit

[Verse 4: Big Sean, Ty Dolla $ign, Both]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah
You know I had these issues when you met me (Ooh yeah)
Results of those post damages that I haven't dealt with
And I only want the best for you, movin' forward
But you backtracking with niggas that ain't shit for you, don't belong around your aura
You know there's not a day in these modern times
You haven't crossed my mind, we both crossed the line
Seems like I needed you more than I needed myself
Just like I always felt like cheatin' on you would be cheatin' myself
To me, that's just some dumb shit for you to say we done with
Tryna speak your heart, tryna make your mark
Then go deeper and make a scar
But every time I lay down I think about you naked
And if you find my replacement, how could you?
I made you come nine times in one day
Your two lips should come in a vase, you rode my face
I realize you look as good as you taste, hmm (Yeah)
Fingers all in your mouth, I'm grabbin' you up and dickin' you down
I'm grabbin' your waist, your room is my only escape
I guess that's none of your concern[Intro]
We love you, Tecca

[Chorus]
I got a pack, hit 'em and do it again
Fuck it, I'm fuckin' her friend

Juggin' 'til a nigga land

[Chorus]

Chopper got a kick, call that shit Jet Li
Sauce Gang dripped up, what is your recipe?
Gon' get an F if a nigga try testin' me

Hit the party fifty deep, nothin' but my shottas
Nigga tried me so you know I had to pop him
So many bullets, it confused the doctor
Whole lotta racks, whole lotta stacks
Fuck a headshot, I'ma shoot him in the back
Three-point-five rolled up in the Cack'
We don't smoke reggie, this shit called gas
I'm sticked up like a blind man
I'm super hot like a frying pan
He say that he gon' take somethin' from me
Ayy, just know, he lyin', man
I'ma up from my hip then blow like a whistle
Your bitch suckin' dick like a Kool-Aid pickle
Two bullets in your chest, that's a nipple
And if a nigga run up, I'ma pop him like a pimple
Get rich or die tryin', I'm feelin' like 50
Brand new chopper got double-D titties
Nigga, don't play me, I don't get silly
Love all the beef like a Southwest Philly, yeah

[Interlude]
Yeah, love all the beef like a Southwest Philly, yeah, ayy
Bet, love all the beef like a Southwest Philly

Yessirski[Verse 1]
Same old dive, same old end of the work week drink
Bartender knows my name, but I don't mind
She kicks 'em up strong, serves me up right

[Chorus]
And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well, it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

[Verse 2]
Another girl, another dance to a country song
Turnin' me on, here's to a good time
And halfway to feelin' alright

[Chorus]
And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

Single, drinkin' doubles
Teardrops turnin' into bubbles
Yeah, a little later on
I'll probably find me some trouble

[Chorus]
And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

[Outro]
Heartache medication takin' me away
Oh whoa[Intro: Future & Post Malone]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, you'd die for me
Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)
Got no patience no more (No), been waitin' too long (Yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy, ooh)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake (Awake)
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Ooh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)
I'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)
And you know (Ayy) it’s all (Ayy) over now
All your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out

[Chorus: Post Malone & Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me (High with me)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (Side I see)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)

[Verse 2: Future]
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights (Yeah)
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)
Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)

[Chorus: Future]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Know you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[Verse 3: Halsey]
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though

[Chorus: Post Malone & Halsey, Halsey]
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
(But you lied, you lied, you lied)[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart[Intro]
Pipe that shit up, TNT
I just wanna be loved
D-Mac on the fuckin' track
Don’t nobody understand me though
Tahj Money
The way I came in the game
The image that I had put out
They wouldn't expect me to have feelings
Know it probably don't seem like it
That’s why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is
But I'm still being me
I'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah
That's how we livin' and that's how we going out, you hear me? Open your mouth

[Verse 1]
I say, mama, I'm so sorry
I got ice burned where my heart at
On the road where I had it hard at
How I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless
I ain't know my age, he was 16, they killed Lil Dave
Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from ‘way from me
I wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene
Go in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve
Right now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me

[Chorus]
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild

[Verse 2]
I fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me
I'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic
Happiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me
You don't know what I'm feelin'
Or what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me
I miss my fuckin' daddy, I've been callin' Montana my father
Times been gettin' harder
I came from nothing, now bitch, I'm royal
I call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda
I don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under
My paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own
Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beeping plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out
These bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs
I'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome
I wish that I can hear Dump say, "What up, lil brother," one more time
We killing shit and plus we dying
I'm gon' go off behind my brother, fuck this charge, I slang that iron
Before he go and I don't ride

[Chorus]
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild
I'm just a lonely child
Who need someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, my pain away
Because my thoughts been runnin' wild

[Outro]
Oh, oh Lord
I need some help because my life been real hard
The way I approached the game, it seem that I'm hard
But I got feelings too just like a lil' boy, oh Lord
I'm a grandmom baby[Verse 1]
I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough
Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low?
Remind me once again just who I am, because I need to know

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Verse 2]
The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me
In You, I find my worth; in You, I find my identity

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Bridge]
Taking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet
You have every failure, God
You'll have every victory

[Chorus]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours
And I believe, I believe
What You say of me
I believe

[Outro]
Oh, I believe
Yes, I believe
What You say of me
Oh, I believe[Intro]

I've never been one to ask for help
If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself
I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
Quote you the scripture kind
I'm far from a preacher
But I'm a believer

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Verse 2]
For someone to love me like you do
Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
A touch that kills me too
And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it

[Chorus 1]
'Cause every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

[Chorus 2]
Every single day, before I knew your name
I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain
Girl, even today, I prayed for you
I kept my faith like that old King James
Said I'm supposed to
It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you
I prayed for you
I prayed for you[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I’m changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of "wreck" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need…

[Post-Chorus]
Time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh, oh)
I just need time (Oh)
I, I need time (Oh)
Time (Oh), time (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever
Ask you to take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No
All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

[Verse 2]
I know you sayin', "Hit my line"
I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Really want to give your all
But flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doing the most
But we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
Quit your talking, back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my

[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

[Outro]
Games, games
Games, oh, games
We got London on the track[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Outro: Eric Church]
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh
(You good, T-Minus?)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, circumnavigate the globe as the cash grows (Grow)
Get a nigga whacked like you get the grass mowed (Mowed)
I'm talkin' slick when I'm with the Big Slime, nigga (Slime)
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga (Mine)
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga (Huh, slide)
No catfishin', this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hitch a ride, go to Mars
Everybody sing
How could you come up out your face
And say I ain't the hardest nigga you done ever heard?
I left a flock of rappers dead and buried
A verse from me is like eleven birds
Just did the math, that's like two thousand dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it
"I know—I know you in high demand"
I'm ballin' on a pussy nigga like Juwanna Mann
I'm drownin' all inside the pussy like I never swam
Ayy, fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk (Woo)
Up north, down south, Bankhead to Rachel Walk (Ayy)
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal cord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter (Let's go)
I'ma run the compound (Yeah)
I supply the cigarettes and bread (Woo)
I got a main and she gon' ride (Uh-huh)
She took a quarter and she fled (Uh)
I'm in the Lamb', so she gon' ride (Yeah)
I see the pain in shawty's light brown eyes (Ooh)
I'm at The London with some big thots
No fries, she eat steaks with the fish sides
Didn't your mama tell you when something on fire, stop, drop and roll? (Aw yeah)
I've been on the road like a pair of spinners at Stop-N-Go's (Yeah)
I could charge 'em like a Dodge Hemi Demon
Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they want start
And we leave them on the cement (Grra, grra)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Me-meet me at The London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things we can't undo
You just send the pin, I can find you
6'1", on the money, 9'2"

Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah, I knew

[Outro: Travis Scott]
I, crash down, we get money (Hey)
For the full town (Woah, when you won't play, I)
I decided, for the full side (Hoes will say)
And they know, I might (And fly, I...)
Get down, might (Don't play)
See the whole town every time, I... (Oh, every day)
Yeah, they know what's up (Folks will say)[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down[Intro]

Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry (I feel so sorry)
I feel so sad (I feel so sad)

But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all

Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it, you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
"Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, you'll go down in history"

I've cheated and I’ve lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I’ve got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don’t like
Runnin’ with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I’ve been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Mmm
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right

[Verse 2]
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I changed
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (To walk away)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was gettin' crazy, reckless, and wild
Actin' like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (Find its place)

[Chorus]
I’ve been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kinda guy girls' mamas don't like
Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Oh
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right

[Bridge]
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, I got one thing right

[Chorus]
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right (I got one thing right)
Been the kinda guy girls mamas don't like
Runnin' with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you

[Post-Chorus]
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Oh
(Baby, I got one thing right)
Yeah, I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasin' all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kinda lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right (I got one thing right)[Intro: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Oh, oh-oh

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Billy Ray Cyrus]
Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Refrain: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no moreChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that santa's on his way -
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so i'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times
Many ways: "merry christmas to you"

Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte
(Ayy, come here, man, haha)
Ooh
(Señorita, she is beautiful, no?)
We The Best Music (Oh-nah-nah)
Sabes bien que fue un engaño (Oh-nah-nah)
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado (Another one)
Así mismo me engañaste (DJ Khaled)

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh why? (Oh why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day he'll grow up and be a man
And lately you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slipping at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

[Outro: J Balvin, Jeremih, & DJ Khaled]
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillan en la luz son los que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh, you stay
Tell me why you (Another one)
Ma', la verdad es un orgullo tenerte a mi lado
Cuando tus ojos brillian me dan luz solo que me fascinan
No hay quién te gane
You stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay, oh
Think you're too loyal[Intro: Khalid]
Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Verse 2: Halsey]
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Bridge: Halsey & Khalid]
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now

[Outro: Halsey & Khalid]
He used to meet me on the Eastside

Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Chorus: Lee Brice & Carly Pearce, Lee Brice]

Saturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see

[Chorus: Khalid & Kane Brown]
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do

[Bridge: Khalid & Kane Brown]
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
'Cause I care (I care), I care about you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here around you
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
I care (I care), care about you (Care about you)
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
There's nowhere I'd rather be

[Chorus: Kane Brown, Kane Brown & Khalid,]
With all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care about you the way that I do, oh
All the things that I know that your parents don't
Don't care about you the way that I, the way that I do
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do (Do-do-do)
The way that I do (Do-do-do, ah)
The way that I do, I do, oh (Do-do-do, do-do-do, ah)[Verse 1]
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been so good at smiling
Most of your life

[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

[Chorus]
But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Oh

[Verse 2]
Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?

[Pre-Chorus]
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

[Chorus]
What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Oh yeah (Ooh)
Even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm, mmm (Ooh)

[Outro]
Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode

[Part II]

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some—Some—Some—Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl—Pl—Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Pl-Pl-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Pl—Playin' for keeps
Someone said, motherfucker—someone said
Don't play us for weak

Nothin' nice (Yeah), baguettes in my ice (Aw, man)

[Chorus: Drake & Travis Scott]
She's in love with who I am
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance
Now I hit the FBO with duffels in my hands (Woo)

Keep it real, this how I'm comin' in it from the jump
You're so beautiful, I kiss and hit it from the front
Take you everywhere with me 'cause I love to stunt
Money everywhere, baby, 'cause you love to stunt
Hit the strip club with me, make ten G's
We'll be runnin' up the bag 'til it empties
Got a temper 'cause she bad, don't tempt me
Shawty, I'm a different man off the Hennessy
Tryna hit it so good you remember me
Pussy good like
Fuckin' your body, I let it go down
I make it ring like the Neptunes song
You hold it down like a stunner, you done cleaned that
You hold it down every summer in Celine bag
Oh, when you're givin' me love, you never keep that
You never give me enough, knowin' I need that
We gon' fuck up the sheets, send 'em to the cleaners
We might smoke weed on the way and catch a misdemeanor
I'm a young nigga that wanna get with you and beat it
My ex hate when I'm with you, it's gettin' her heated

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
'Cause you're so beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Said you're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
What can I say to you that you ain't never heard?
I'm breakin' it down, shawty, I'm talkin' 'bout every word
Observe how I splizz-erve, slick like a iceberg (What?)
Cold with the wizz-ords and lit like my izz-erd (Ah)
Of course it all matters if you with it or not
'Cause if you don't, you won't, but if you get it, you got
Ain't nothin' wrong with this, now peep it out
And if it's too hard, then go ahead and bleep it out
See, I'ma tell you what I see 'cause what I see is all I know
I'll wrap you up with a bow, lay you out on the floor
And let Tory tell the story 'cause you know how it go
Then hit the switch in my blue '64, mmh-mmh

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Beautiful

Well, guess what? I'm the next runner-up
Big bank, baby, and I spend it all on you
Fuck it up in here, that's what we ought to do
A lot of options, I could call 'em through
I switch her option like an audible

You're a Genius, McFly
AI
It’s the Carter's son
The Carter's
Turn me up a lil'

[Verse 1]
Picture me, new 3D denim, I'm city rollin' (Rollin')
But did I mention this my own clothin'?
The fuck you mean?
Made nigga, bought my own Rollie
But if them crackers pull me over, they gon' say I stole it
Good mornin', we on it, I went bought two S trophies
My father left my sis and bros, to them, I feel I owed it
But let's not be heroic, 'cause everybody roguish
They don't want us totin' guns, but they let the fuckin' killers tote it
Let's take a ride and see, though, where them people be, though
Colt 45, the grip design, bought this bitch from Casino
Soprano, no Soprino, we live life like Yung Bino
Had a show in B-more, after that post on the block with Chino (I'm a hustlin' motherfucker)
Look for a star on every hundred, C note
I'm the top on YouTube, fuck a new school, I don't use no Vevo
These niggas 'round me, they too cruel, they bust tools and die for me, though
I don't pay money for no life, the murder pay off me, so

[Chorus]
Came out alright
But I'm blinded from the life, I can’t see, though
Got juveniles on the block, thirty stick hangin' out the Glock
Bandana tied 'round the clip, and they go all out for me, though

[Verse 2]
Sucked all the pain up, let's fuck the game up
Plenty niggas on the block pushin' that rock (It's the Carter's son)
You got your change up, they brought your name up
When it's war, we wet they block, and when it's said, this shit'll never be done
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba
Like, "Load up and come and rob all them" (Rob all them)
Venezuela ventilator
My first trip to Georgia made 'em
Some companions with ambitions, was
Double G, NBA native
I wish baptism could've saved us
Never broke until the grave in
Excuse ourselves, knock on the tables
I make a pussy bite the pavement
I can't say I'm fucking with all this involvement
These niggas ain't right and they ballin'
I don't give a fuck, no, I call up Osama, my baba
Like, "Load up and come and rob all them" (Rob all them)

[Chorus]
Came out alright
But I'm blinded from the life, I can’t see, though
Got juveniles on the block, thirty stick hangin' out the Glock
Bandana tied 'round the clip, and they go all out for me, though

[Outro]
That's my son, that's my slime
He on my dime, it's the Carter's son[Verse 1]
I don’t know about you
But I never come into this bar
On a Thursday before 10 o’clock
But I thought what the hell, why not?

I don’t know about you
But I never walk up and talk to
A stranger but when I saw you
I had to, I just had to

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I know your favourite beer
'Cause you told me and I bought it
You can leave me sitting right here
But if you feel like talking

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin round and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Verse 2]
I don’t know about you
We can dip, we can slip out the back
Flee the scene, put your feet on my dash
Find a spot past the railroad tracks and never look back
But before that

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Bridge]
I know you like Bud Light
I know you got blue eyes
I know you got my heart beating in this bar
Tonight we can jump in, fall into something
And the perfect place to start is

[Chorus]
What’s your name, what’s your sign, what’s your birthday?
What’s your wrist tattoo bible verse say?
Tell me this, do you kiss on the first date?
Don’t hold anything back (don’t hold anything back)

What’s your dream job?
Girl, where’s your hometown?
Yeah, what makes your world spin around and around?
And are you down to get out of here too?
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you

[Outro]
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you
Tell me everything, tell me everything
Tell me everything till there’s nothing I don’t know about you[Verse 1]
You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this cryin', nobody's gonna
Heal me if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me

[Refrain]
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey-ah, hey-ah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)
Hey-ah, hey-ah (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Now, it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late or
Could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if we break in two)

[Refrain]
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now

[Bridge]
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Hey yeah, hey yeah

[Chorus]
I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)

I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love[Verse 1]
Girl, I know you had a long day
You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' there watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Verse 2]
Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now
Girl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad

[Chorus]
I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert & Tyler, The Creator]

She was ridin' on my dick, she ain't need two pedals
I swear these niggas, they bitches

Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em
She save my name in her phone
Only thing she save me under is probably that "U" letter (Hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got fifties on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (Hah)
Jeremy Scotts all on my feet
I had a cougar with me, so I call that girl Coretta (Coretta)
I am the richest nigga in my city

They try to cut me down when they say I'm too low, woah, uh (Turn me up)

Do what I want, I'ma bend your rules (Woah)

Everything I got, man, I got it in a hurry
If I love you, better say that you love me
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me
Talk 'bout the bag, the mula, the guap
I'm at the bank, only time that I'm runnin'

I'm runnin' through obstacles, I'm in a hurry
Woah, stop that

Independent jug
Selling records out the trunk
I'm already rich as fuck
So the products in the front
Got my patna in the front
Been my BF for a month but we been fucking from the jump[Verse 1]
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Verse 2]
Yeah then I hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget and take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me

[Bridge]
I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now

[Chorus]
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats, like you did on me
Like you did on me[Letra de "Soltera (Remix)"]

[Intro: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Épico
Salte 'el medio, ¿okay?
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh, eh (Suénalo)
Me dijeron que te acabas de dejar (Eh)
Que el bobo aquel te engañó
Que ya no crees en el amor (No)
Que andas suelta igual que yo (Bad Bunny)
No sé, pero la noche está pa’ desquitarno' (Hey, hey)
Otro shot vamo' a darno’ (Mujeres, get ready, sube)
Que yo también quiero joder, vacilar (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Trae a to'a tus amiga', que yo las voy a poner a fumar
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar, yeh

[Coro: Lunay, Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Porque 'tar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra, rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda (¿Qué, qué, qué?)
Por eso ella no se enamora (Dile; ¡no!)
Estar soltera está de moda (D-D-D-D-D-D.Y.)
Por eso no va a cambiar (¡Da-ddy Yan-kee!)

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh, wuh), con su' amiga’ revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta’ (Prr)
'Tá soltera (Fuego), con su' amiga' revuelta’
Va pa' la disco y a nadie le rinde cuenta' (Fue', fue'. fue')

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perrear con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (Chi-chi-chi)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-, pónme a prueba, a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pa'l piso no pide permiso (No, wuh!)
Si está soltera, sin compromiso (¿Qué, qué?)
'Tá pa' la rumba y hacer dinero y yo que soy un bandolero
Me gustan como tú, las que no creen en sentimiento' ni un 14 de febrero (D-D-D.Y)

[Pre-Coro: Lunay]
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Chi-chi-chi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar

[Coro: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (¡Ble!)
Estar soltera está de moda (Yeh)
Por eso no va a cambiar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Y estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Blu, blu)
'Ta-'tar soltera está de moda (Sube, sube)
Por eso no va a cambiar

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny & Daddy Yankee]
Yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh
Se cansó de lo' embuste' y a su vida le hizo un ajuste, ey (Prr)
Si la ves en la disco con las de ella', no te asuste' (¡No!)
Puesta pa'l problema, así que no la busque'
Y déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
A ese culo el traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to' las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo "Next"?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

[Verso 3: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Ponte-ponte pa' la vuelta, que yo voy pa'l party (Lunay, dile)
Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party
Ponte pa'l problema, ándale, déjate ver
Lo que aquí empezamo', lo matamo' en el motel (Fuego)
Tú estás suelta por ahí, yo estoy suelto por acá
Hacerte wiki-wiki, como dice Yaviah
Soltó el corazón, sacó a pasear la maldá'
(Tiene la mente dañá')

[Pre-Coro: Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee & Ambos]
(Yeh, yeh)
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Vacilar ¡Wuh!)
Solita pa' romper la disco
Ella lo que quiere e' joder, vacilar (Wi-wi)
Dale hasta abajo, pata' abajo sin parar (Brr)

[Coro: Bad Bunny, Lunay & Daddy Yankee]
Que estar soltera está de moda
Hace lo que quiera y que se joda
Estar soltera está de moda
Ella no le va a bajar (Ella no va a cambiar)
Estar soltera está de moda
Por eso ella no se enamora (Rra-rra)
'Tar soltera está de moda (Sí)
Por eso no va a cam-cam-cambiar (Fue')

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Ella 'tá soltera (Wuh-wuh), con su' amiga' revuelta' (D-D-D)
Revuelta', revuelta', revuelta' (Rrr)
Ella 'tá soltera (¡Fuego!), con su' amiga' revu'

[Verse 1]
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Verse 2]
I long for you
Just a touch (Does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Bridge]
I just want somebody to die for (To die for)
I just want somebody to die for
(Does that scare you?)
(I don't wanna be alone)

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway (Oh)
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (To die for)[Verse 1]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Bridge]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere[Verse 1]
Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no[Intro: Young Thug]
(BL$$D)
I just let lil' mama suck me up, girl
Is you tryna cry in a Rolls Royce or the bus‚ girl?
I jumped off the porch and went straight up‚ girl (Straight up‚ girl)
You can leave your town and head to another world

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
What the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you
I'm tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too
I made it rain on you
When it was hard to maintain too
I was playin' games with you
Like you could never play games too, woah (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)

Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P‚ I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Drip, drip, no shoestring my sneaker, won't trip
My jeans is so tight they don't fit
Still walk around with a stick on my hip
VVS diamonds right behind my lip
Don't walk with less than fifty on my wrist
Diamonds so cold on my neck, it got me sick
Raf Simons, mix it up with the Rick
Flexin' on these haters who sent me 'my bad'
Made it from the soil, made it from the Rex
Richer than your first, richer than your last
LUV, know I got swag
Pop a rubber band, pop another Xan'
I groove around, party pack my hand
I'm seeing double lookin' through my lens
Tell me what you want, I just want your friend

You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)

We known to pick the brains of a bitch (Big bag)
I throw the big B's on a bitch
I got a few C's on a bitch (Got slatt)
I'm in another league on a bitch
My diamond 'bout to ski on a bitch (Woo)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
What's the move?
I'm tired of eyein' you (Oh, yeah)
I was tired of spyin' on you
'Til the pain mines too (Yeah)
Make it rain on you (Make it rain, rain)
It was hard to maintain too, ooh (It was hard to maintain)
I was playin' games with you
Like you couldn't play games too, hey, okay

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You just gotta tell me what you want (Tell me what you want)
Louis Vuitton, diamonds, keep calm (Okay)
All you do is point at what you want (Point it out)
Crystal cut pointers in the charm, c'mon (Oh yeah)
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
Nigga tryna buy the cash cost (Woo)
Percy Miller, brazy with the woes
Thirty-five dollars for a duff' (For a duff')
You make it twerk for me
You get a purse from me
Eighty thousand dollars for her Birkin
You get a verse for free
I make her worship me
Copy it in bursts for me
Turn to a P-I-M-P, I make her work for me
You don't want the bag, oh no, no, no
I make her drop it and pop it and work it on my nose
I make her shut up then suck it, she fuckin' at my shows, mmh
I make her shut up, she fuckin', she suckin' at my shows, ayy[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You're only the love of my life (Love of my life)

[Chorus]
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh[Verse 1]
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when my bones are good
When the bones are good

[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Outro]

I done seen it all, oh my God
Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

[Verse 2: Lute]
Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

[Verse 3: DaBaby]
I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a Glock with a dick, let's get physical
They gon' be hollerin' out, "Rip," and they missin' you
They got me started, I might as well finish it (Talk your shit)
I'm from Charlotte, you know how these niggas do
Baby

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with[Intro]

It's the way you put it down

Been running from it for the longest time

My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind

[Chorus]

So we're there, now it's real
Now that you have me, do you want me still?
My kisses are history, they go back a long time, uh
And I'm tired of loving somebody that's not mine, no

[Pre-Chorus]
So many mornings I woke up confused
In my dreams, I do anything I want to you
My emotions are naked, they're taking me out of my mind (Mind)

Screamin' my lungs out for ya
Not afraid to face it

A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Ridin' roads

[Verse 2]
Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the street signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this
Ridin' roads

[Bridge]
I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin' 'til the sunri-ri-rise

[Chorus]
Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
The only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Just ridin' roads on a night like this (Oh)
Ridin' roads[Intro: Jerrod Carmichael]
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now
(New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator & Santigold]
I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

When I walk in the spot, thirty on me
Buy out the club, niggas know that I'm paid
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit
I can't fuck with these niggas 'cause niggas is gay
All on my page suckin' dick
All in my comments and screamin' my name
While I'm in the club, throwin' them hundreds and fifties and ones and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time
If you need the glizzy, you could take mine
Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT
Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it
I bet I air it like BNB
Nappy Blue wildin' in my section
And I keep that .38 for the weapon
Remember when I came home from corrections
All the bad bitches in my direction

[Chorus]
She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a nigga

Ayy
Gang, gang, gang, ayy (Mike WiLL Made-It)
Lil' Capalot, bitch, hah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

[Verse 1: Polo G & Stunna 4 Vegas]
Hit the strip after school, couldn't wait 'til I got out of class, used to stare at the clock and shit
Before all of this rappin' shit, I was gangbangin' and doin' high-speeds on the cops and shit
And I'm straight from the Chi, but I ball like a king up in Cali and shoot like Stojaković
Keep applyin' that pressure, I go on the run, it ain't no lettin' it up, ain't no stoppin' this
Had to tell my lil' brother to chill, gotta stay in the house, come outside, he be poppin' shit
You ain't heard about us, well, you need to go watch the news, niggas know we be dropping shit
Got the feds on my ass in the hood 'cause they think I'm the one who been buyin' up Glocks and shit
I'm just focused on music, they say my last tape was a classic, but I got some hotter shit (Hotter shit)
Might be rocking a show or if I'm not up the stu', then I'm fucking this cash off
Don't you know Polo G? Skinny tall with the dreads, that lil' nigga be rappin' his ass off
Yeah, I heard she got surgery, still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
Go like Harden with rockets, we blast off
Tried to throw us some bullets, but we made 'em fumble, like nah, you ain't gettin' that pass off
Spin the block, now I'm takin' my mask off
Hit the gas like we racin', speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
It's gon' be R.I.P. once your ass caught
He like frontin', we knockin' his cap off
'Nother day, a new chain or a MAC bought
All this ice got me freezin' like Jack Frost (4X)

[Verse 2: Stunna 4 Vegas & NLE Choppa]
That boy a bitch, that's his dad fault
If you play, then you lay, we can crash out (Let's go)
When I up in his shit, bet it's man down (Boom)
In BOA, I'm pullin' them bands out (Cash)
DOA, bitch, I get your mans off (Gone)
A rockstar from the block, I stand out (Uh)
Came from nothing, I fucked my advance off
When I hit the game, with my flow, niggas ran off (No cap), fuck it
I'm not your average joe (Uh-uh)
When I leave the house, I tuck it, uh (Fire, fire)
I'm rich, I don't shop on no budget
He clutchin', my lil' youngin want him a bucket, uh (Score)
I hop on this bitch and run it (Uh)
If I said it, I seen it or done it (Uh, uh)
These lil' niggas never robbed nobody
Ain't caught no body, and ain't getting no money (Cap)
Where I'm from, it's sports or gunplay
We looked up to the killer and dealers
But even them niggas wan' make it out one day (On gang)
Fuck my first M, I been had hood fame (Yeah)
Took off like I was on a runway (Yoom)
I'm a star, but still post on the one way (Blatt)
Them niggas talk, but they won't play (NLE)
We let them guns sing like the choir on Sunday (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: NLE Choppa]
Hop on the scene and I'm thuggin'
This Glock on my hip, so you know that I'm clutchin'
Catch me an opp, I'ma down him in public
The police keep askin', I'm changin' the subject
The way I grew up, man, a nigga was rugged
Why the fuck you got a gun? You not gonna bust it
And a hundred some shots, I ain't doin' no tustlin'
Give a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin
I ain't gon' cap, I don't even like rappin'
But I love wrappin' them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch, and when I get done
I'ma up my Glock and then rob the bitch
Catch a nigga when he clock out
I'ma get him whacked at his job and shit
And I don't know why the police keep fuckin' with me
'Cause they ain't stoppin' shit, yeah
Spin on your block like a remix
Shoot him in the face, get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind, we keep duckin'
My gun need some drawers, it got nuts
Whole gang, we strapped, don't test us
If a nigga play, he gon' get bust, yeah
NLE the Top Shotta, don dada
Got the bombs like Al-Qaeda
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah[Verse 1]
They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine
Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine"
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Chorus]
So they say
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"
They say
"Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you’re done, I'll make you do it all again"

[Verse 2]
I said, "Oh my God, I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes"
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin’ my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Chorus]
So they say
"Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before"

4PF look like we hit licks how we sell bricks
We don't sell shit, we just make hits, yeah
Turn up

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Keepin' my composure, never sober
Never chokin', always smokin doja
Fuck 'em if they gettin' over
Got a Moncler coat because the kid the coldest
I ain't changed, I stayed the same and maintained
It's safe to say the kid gettin' older
Forever gang, I'm never switchin' over
Made a lane and niggas can't get over
I can't match with rappers, they be bogus
Really get a pack and keep the over
Big dripper, stand up in the ocean
Everybody trappin', we get loads in
He ain't 4PF if he ain't got motion
Made a half a ticket off promotion
Shout out Swishers Sweet, they keep me rollin'
But if we catch the opp, we gotta smoke him
Ridin' 'round with Dracs like we OVO
I got some racks and I want some more
Still got them passin' the hood, call it give-and-go
Keep a nigga main bitch in a figure-four
Let me fuck when I want, I just come and go
Man, these racks gettin' too big for these skinny clothes
I might put me an M in some big Girbaud
Let lil' bro hit the stick, had start gettin' old
I spent five hundred racks on a Lambo'
And didn't even know how to make that motherfucker go
On my birthday, I just wanna lift the door
Barely flex, but don't play with me, period
Shooters follow behind in a Urus
In the Rolls truck, I feel like a tourist
I'm the one from the bottom who sold all my partners them pounds
Used to drive in a Buick

[Chorus: Lil Baby & Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, I'm heatin' up
I fuck with slimes and I'm gonna bust (Bah, bah)
He can't put on that drip, he ain't one of us
How you ridin' in a Benz and a Tonka truck?
How you got everybody lit, pipin' up?
Oh, she bad with no swag, I can pipe her up
Made my last one my last one, I'm wifin' her
Count the money up fast like I'm typin' somethin'
I'm the type to get active and never run (Wunna)

[Verse 2: Gunna]
Keep the Rugers, my niggas ain't scared of nothin' (Nah)
And ain't no rules, you got racks, you can get it done (Yeah)
On a light day, I keep me a honey bun (One hundred)
Makin' hit after hit, call me Barry Bonds (Hits)
For this Christmas, I bought everybody guns (Swear)
Glocks and choppers and FN's for everyone (Grrat)
Take that roof off the car, let her feel the sun (Wow)
My bro go see his barber five times a month (Yeah)
Got this bitch out the college, she suckin' and swallow (Uh)
I stick it in, she feel it in her gut (In her gut)
We don't run from our problems, we stackin' up guala and guala I'm tryna get that mega bucks (Racks)
We them drippers, lil' nigga, best watch your step (Them drippers)
This top shelf, got forty designer belts (Drip)
4PF look like the new BMF
Think I'm deaf, got stones in my right and left (Ice)
How you crank up the car? Ain't no key in there
Just pull up, spin they block, and get out of there (Get out of there)
Wake up, have a hard time findin' what to wear
Treat these hoes like a tire, I keep a spare
Want a strap because I'm war ready (War)
Check the trust account, it's more fetti (Yeah)
Skydweller, Jubilee, and a Presi' (No cap)
Hundred-fifty plain Richard Millie (No cap)
I'ma milk the game until it's empty
Lil cuzzo spit that flame until it's empty (Yeah)
I am not a killer, but don't tempt me (Nah)
Spendin' rate 'bout thousand to a fifty

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Hot, hot, hot, I'm heatin' up
I fuck with slimes and I'm gonna bust (Bah, bah)
He can't put on that drip, he ain't one of us
How you ridin' in a Benz and a Tonka truck?

Oh, she bad with no swag, I can pipe her up
Made my last one my last one, I'm wifin' her
Count the money up fast like I'm typin' somethin'

And the way I'm all on you, girl, you know it's true
The way I speak, it's my melody
Don't you ever think it's another me
Girl, on everything, it's a lot on me
I cannot be seen, I cannot be takin' apologies
Yeah, they plot on me, 'cause that bag on me
Yeah, they after me, I got racks on me
Got the stash on me, think they gassin' me
Yeah, hoodie on low but I stay focused
Yeah, it's hard to stay low when everybody notice, yeah

Look back at it
She ain't never do this before, but she good at it
Said she never made love, but she good at it

Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

[Chorus]
I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

[Verse 2]
Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door

But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

[Chorus]
Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'

Tour was up middle of June
She was plannin' a welcome home barbecue
Green bean casserole, grandma's recipe
There was a knock on the door around two o'clock
Two uniforms and her heart stopped
Yellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

[Verse 2]
The whole town shut down, the whole town showed up
Sang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of
His 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears
And that preacher talked about sacrifice
And traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights
Johnny sold beer half priced that night
And everybody raised 'em high singin'

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home

[Bridge]
Back to that front porch
Back through that front door
To the life they were fightin' for

[Chorus]
Here's to the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones we ain't seen in so long
The hold up a beer ones
The wish they were here ones
The not forgotten but gone
In a better place up there
But they sure left a hole down here
We just go on livin' and go on missin'
The ones, the ones that didn't make it back home
The ones that didn't make it back home[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Goodnight" and your first "Good day"
So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You ain't trying to be wasting time
On stupid people and cheap lines I'm sure, I'm sure
So I‘d give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors, these doors

I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo!

You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at?
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad

Dawg, it's these jealous ass hoes I can't relate to
The type to follow you but hardly follow through
You say I'm on your mind, I'm wondering why I'm not on you
Girl, you're fresh out the shower
Towel around your head like you're Erykah Badu
It's lookin' like a spa day
I rearrange your chakras, listenin' to Sade
Let's take a road trip and get high on the highway (Swerve, swerve)
Migrate, spend time, lay back, watch the sky change, woah
And I hear the jealousy, but look, I never listen
The quickest way to let something die is lack of attention (Straight up)
And you got it all, you looking good as my intentions (Damn)
We on an ascension, straight up

But girl, I can tell you need some love in your life (Let's ride)

We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you[Verse 1: Alec Benjamin]
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

[Pre-Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

[Chorus: Alec Benjamin]
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
I hold on to little pieces of what we were
I know we're long gone, but take it easy
Because it hurts

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a girl with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely

Let me down, down, let me down, down, let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me

Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Verse 1: Luke]
Why do we always gotta run away?
And we wind up in the same place
It's like we're looking for the same thing
Same thing, yeah
Yeah, do we really gotta do this now?
Right here with all your friends around
In the morning, we can work it out
Work it out

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]
I love you so much that I hate you
Right now, it's so hard to blame you
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
So damn beautiful

[Chorus: Luke, with All]
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know that you're always gonna stay the same
Is it easier to stay? Is it easier to go?
I don't wanna know, oh
But I know that I'm never, ever gonna change
And you know you don't want it any other way

[Verse 2: Luke]
Every time that you say you're gonna leave
That's when you get the very best of me
You know we need it like the air we breathe
Air we breathe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, with All]
I love you so much that I hate you (Oh)
Right now, it's so hard to blame you (Oh)
'Cause you're so damn beautiful (Oh)

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]
"Come on, little lady, give us a smile"
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Bridge]
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night[Chorus: NAV]
Tourin', I'm sellin' out shows
Made a cult followin' like Jim Jones (Yeah)
Drippin', I be puttin' shit on
Lookin' at the crowd, I see a couple lil' clones (Woah)
Blow a girl a kiss, hit the gas then I'm gone
Expensive drugs keep me in my zone (Oh-oh)
Treat a record deal like a loan
Makin' these hits gon' keep me on (Come on)

[Post-Chorus: NAV]
Found a lil' redbone, fuck her like a G
Pull her weave out, makin' her moan (Like a G)
Smoke a lot of weed, gotta get another pound
I don't know where the other one gone (It's gone)
Every time I'm drivin' down the strip
Got people throwin' thumbs up at my whip (Skrrt)
In the club sparklers comin'
They hittin' off diamonds inside of the VIP (Bling)

[Verse 1: NAV]
Since 2017 I been gettin' paid (Gettin' paid)
Monograms on my waist, watches in the LV roller case (Let's go)
I gotta play it safe, shooter mask on, can't trace no face
Got a good lawyer, now I ain't got no case
This shit I'm around, I don't think it's a waste (Yeah)
They said that I was ugly, now everything in my life is beautiful (Beautiful)
Back in the day, every time I went to Walmart, God knows that I stole (Yes, I did)
Hit it with the cut then we breakin' it down, we ain't tryna sell it whole (No)
Straight from the hood, fuck the politics, cut the check, I'll do the Super Bowl (No cap)
Well-spoken, I'm talkin' to girls, I'm makin' 'em wanna fornicate (Let's go)
I was broke three years ago but it still feel like it was yesterday (Yesterday)
Runnin' out of space, I got a lot of drip I already gave away
Twinklin' toes, my diamonds keep dancing like they doin' ballet

[Chorus: NAV]
Tourin', I'm sellin' out shows
Made a cult followin' like Jim Jones (Yeah)
Drippin', I be puttin' shit on
Lookin' at the crowd, I see a couple lil' clones (Woah)

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
No I'm not, um, Marshall Applewhite, but I'm tryna phone home (Home, woah)
I feel like it's someone watchin' me, I had to get a clone
Drinkin' that Kool-Aid, just out a white cup
This ain't nothin' but a four (Four)
I'm not tryna take your life
I'm tryna take you out of space, movin' slow (Slow, woah)
She give me head like a comb
I break her heart like Comme des Garçons (Damn)
I know she bad to the bone
She think when I'm mad the reason why it storms, yeah
I just got a bad freak-freak
Never saw her feet, make her walk on her knees (Yeah)
Hit it from the back, yeah, that girl got a peach
She think I'm God, made the girl say, "Capiche," yeah
Her ass like a Jeep, yeah
Make her back it up, beep-beep, yeah (Beep, beep, beep)
Won't touch, I won't reach, yeah
Because, that girl, she is not cheap, yeah (No)
Necklace full of stone
Smokin' on Runtz, bitch, I'm too stoned
Y'all thought I was gon' fold
No, y'all put me right in my zone

In the club sparklers comin'
They hittin' off diamonds inside of the VIP (Bling)[Verse 1]
All my life, been hustlin', and tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs, and my pimp's a record label
This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave, a climber and a sadist, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look ma, I made it, hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it’s a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it”

[Verse 2]
Friends are happy for me or they're honeysuckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers while these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust, then trust me, you'll be lonely, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

[Chorus]
Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it, I made it”
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it, I made it”
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

[Outro]
I said, “Hey look ma, I made it”
(Mama best believe it, Mama best believe it)
Hey look ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin', wide awake and dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it, Mama best believe it)
Hey look ma, I made it
(Think I must be dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it[Intro: Lil Peep]
Whoa, yeah

[Verse 1: iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep]

I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading (Yeah)
When I fall apart, your needle sews my heart, oh

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want

Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine

Of your uniform, your uniform of non-conformity
The tears, the tears
Tears aren't strong enough, the years aren't long enough, no

Fuck me up and make me just go crazy
Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily

[Post-Chorus: Patrick Stump]
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

[Verse 3: Patrick Stump]
Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
(Always on the tip of my tongue)

[Verse 4: iLoveMakonnen & Lil Peep]
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' (I've been waitin')
Long for you (Long for you)

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget

[Chorus: iLoveMakonnen]
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain?

It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come

I'll be waiting (For you)
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
(I'll be waiting for you)[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
I'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
You ain't my boyfriend (Boyfriend)
And I ain't your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody

Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love (Love)
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove (Shove)
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too (Too)
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah

[Verse 3: Scootie & Ariana Grande]
I wanna kiss you (Yeah), don't wanna miss you (Yeah)
But I can't be with you 'cause I got issues (No)
Yeah, on the surface, seem like it's easy
Careful with words, but it's still hard to read me
Stress high when the trust low (Mmm)
Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? (Oh)
Try to open up and love more (Love more)
Try to open up and love more

[Bridge: Scootie, Ariana Grande & Both]
If you were my boyfriend
And you were my girlfriend
I prolly wouldn't see nobody else
But I can't guarantee that by myself

I don't want a friend (Just one more night)
I want my life in two (My life in two)
Please one more night
Waiting to get there
Waiting for you (Waiting for you)
Just one more night
I'm done fighting all night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
You done made up your mind
I don't need no more signs
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
When you gotta run
Just hear my voice in you (My voice in you)
Shutting me out you (Shutting me out)
Doing so great (So great, so great)
You

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Used to be the one to hold you when you fall
Yeah, yeah, yeah (When you fall, when you fall)
I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Can it be one night?
Can you?
Can you?

[Chorus]
Give me reasons we should be complete
You should be with him, I can't compete
You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
Can't you see?
I don't wanna slow dance (I don't wanna slow dance)
In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark[Verse 1]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Verse 2]
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

[Chorus]
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

[Bridge]
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

[Chorus]
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved[Verse 1]

We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

[Bridge]
I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4"
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6"
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 3]
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

[Refrain]
We be throwin' money in a spiral

Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Forrest]
Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Forrest]
Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

[Pre-Chorus: Forrest]
Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

[Chorus: Forrest]
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best[Chorus: BENEE]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser

While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah

[Verse 1: BENEE]
Water pouring down from the ceiling
I knew this would happen, still hard to believe it
Maybe I'm dramatic, I don't wanna seem it
I don't wanna panic

I'm a sad girl in this big world, it's a mad world
All of my friends know what's happened, you're a bad thing (Ah)

Now I'm in the bathtub cryin'
Think I'm slowly sinking
Bubbles in my eyes now
Maybe I'm just dreamin'
Now I'm in the sad club
Just tryna get a back rub (Lonely)

I'm a sad girl in this big world, it's a mad world

[Bridge: Gus Dapperton]
I loathe romancing in itself, yeah, I'd be damned to try
I'm only dancin' by myself, so I don't slam my Irish buck
Compostable cups, B-B-BENEE, I can't stress this enough
I would hate to mess things up, but my boogie still stays restless as fuck, yeah

[Chorus: BENEE & Gus Dapperton, BENEE]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter
While you're out there drinkin', I'm just here thinkin'
'Bout where I should've been
I've been lonely, mmh, ah, yeah

[Post-Chorus: BENEE]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I'm a lonely bitch)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (Super lonely)

[Outro: BENEE]
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la (I've been lonely, I've been lonely)
Lonely (I've been lonely, by the way)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Lonely (I've been lonely)[Verse 1]
I wish this whiskey would make her miss me
Like I wish she did, I wish she did
Pouring up another one won't change what I should have done
Before she left, now all that's left is

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Mile by mile and
City by city she's
Gettin' over me, and man it ain't pretty, no

[Chorus]
She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Verse 2]
I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, man I would
Try and make her see
That me and Tennessee want her back
I wish it worked like that
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If I had half a clue
Where she was headed now
I'd do what I had to do
To make her turn that car around

[Chorus]
She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Bridge]
Yeah, I should've held her close
I should've let her know
How I felt about her 'bout a couple county lines ago

[Chorus]
She's out there rolling down some old interstate
Wide open, wide open
Couldn't make her stay
Probably cranking up some new freedom song
Wide open, wide open
Won't pick up her phone
While I'm dying here tonight
Staring goodbye in the face
Saying I love you too late
Too late

[Outro]
Yeah
I love you too late
I can't take back what I never said
But if I could, damn I would[Verse 1]
Man, this shit's unflatterin', all up in my head again
I don't feel myself right now, maybe I should just lay down
If vanity's my vitamin, well, I don't feel the difference
I don't like myself right now, gotta find a way out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What you feel is natural
But I don't wanna feel this anymore
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor
What you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Verse 2]
Draw your comparisons, tryin' to find who's lesser than
I don't wanna wear your crown, there's enough to go around

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you feel is natural (Natural)
You don't gotta put up with this anymore (Anymore)
Pick yourself up off the kitchen floor (Oh)
Tell me what you waitin' for?

[Chorus 1]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl

[Bridge]
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, don't lose your halo
Girl, don't hang your head low
Don't lose your halo, oh

[Chorus 2]
Girl, won't you stop your cryin'?
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay
Baby girl, won't you stop your cryin'? (Won't you stop your cryin'?)
I know that you're tryin'
Everything's gonna be okay (Everything's gonna be okay)
Baby girl, don't you hang your head low
Don't you lose your halo
Everyone's gonna be okay (Everyone's gonna be okay)
Baby girl

[Outro]
Everyone's gonna okay, baby
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm

[Chorus]
Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she block me
Thirty in this Perky, need to slow down on the Roxys
Got a call, my nigga died, I damn near skipped a heartbeat
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out
We was really in the trenches, thuggin' in the Choppa house
Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' bang it out

[Verse]
I don't even know which car I'ma drive (Drive)
Roll a three-five, now I'm too damn high (I'm too damn high)
Bitch, I'm in my zone, don't you kill my vibe (Don't you kill my vibe)
If a nigga play, you know them choppers gon' ride
That micro Draco clip, it look like a banana (Like a banana)
A nigga look wrong in this bitch, we gonna blam him (Grr, grr, grr, grr, grr)
A lot of choppers when we ride, raise the count up (Raise the count up)
I robbed the corner store, the gun over the counter
And I ain't gotta spin back because I know he dead
Ain't no surviving when you shoot a nigga right in his head
Paramedics asking questions 'bout that boy and the meds
But they know he ain't gon' make it, so they pronounced him dead

[Chorus]
Get a bitch and make her famous, next minute she block me
Thirty in this Perky, need to slow down on the Roxys
Got a call, my nigga died, I damn near skipped a heartbeat
Lookin' for your love, but your feelings is departing

We was really in the trenches, thuggin' in the Choppa house
Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' bang it out

They gon' feel me, NLE the motherfuckin'...
NLE the top shotta, yeah
Pull up on the wrong street, you niggas getting blicked out
Gun up in my hand while I fuck her with my dick out
We was really in the trenches thuggin' in the Choppa house
Don't you tell me that it's smoke, because you know that we gon' make it out[Verse 1]
Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

[Verse 2]
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

[Chorus]
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now

Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up

Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back

[Verse 1: Idina Menzel]
I can hear you, but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers, which I wish would go away, oh

[Refrain: Idina Menzel & AURORA]
Ooh
Oh
Ooh, ah

[Verse 2: Idina Menzel]
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for, I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls

[Pre-Chorus]
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

[Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

[Refrain: AURORA]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 3: Idina Menzel]
What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?

[Pre-Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Every day's a little harder as I feel my power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go

[Chorus: Idina Menzel]
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown

Since you've been gone, I've been just okay
I know you mad, you didn't see it my way
Since I've been gone, I've been out of space
I let lil' shawty, come here, take your place

[Outro]
Ooh, you got it (Got it)
You couldn't keep my love, you too exotic (Couldn't keep my love, yeah)
You want a paper plane, I don't mind it (You want a paper plane, yeah)
You wonder why your girl always smiling (Wonder why your girl, yeah)[Intro: Future]
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus]
Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

[Verse 1]
Put it in a Uber, send it to a shooter
Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab
Hit 'em with the MAC now, now his whole body scabbed
Cash on delivery (Ayy)
G.O.A.T. talk of the century (Oh)
No time for gibberish, all the critics hearin' this
All the bitches lipstick, and her pussy slippery
I can call a troop, go by the name of Duke
Kidnap a kangaroo, I can send a moose (Woo)
Niggas stole a chain, but I ain't worried, fool
I'ma keep on spinnin' 'til they tell me who

[Chorus]
Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'

I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

[Verse 2]
I don't gotta throw you shit like Kaepernick, nah
I got seven bitches with me, Kaepernick
Yeah, R.I.P. Nipsey, I can tell you how to get rich
I can tell you how to die or how to live in this bitch
I can tell you how to talk the most impeccable shit
I can show you how to walk like you got decimals, bitch
Show you how I can get the top from all the top ten bitches
I got white Adderalls and I have amoxicillin
I got lights on, baby, I got moths in this bitch
No fly zone, caught you like you're Moss in this bitch
Growin' tycoon and I took some losses, you bitch
I'm a boss, but I don't like to take a loss in this bitch (Wheezy outta here)
Such a player but I cake and cuddle all of my bitches
I got layers, I got millions, I got all type of buildings
Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox
Ask the cops, ask the detectives, they know all the business
Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings
I don't know and I don't wanna know who 'flaged Bentleys
I don't know what's goin' with bro, I think they all spillin'
We don't speak 'bout shit on wax, it's all mob business
We known to kill the biggest cats of all kitties

[Куплет 1: Dicon]
Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана "Мозга" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...

[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

[Куплет 2: Dicon]
Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

[Припев: Dicon]
Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

[Куплет 3: Dicon]
Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!

Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...

Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!
Хах[Verse 1]
(I saw you going by)
I saw you going by, I had to say hello
And I don't mean to pry, but girl, I gotta know
What is your name?
How come I ain't seen you around before? (Tell me)
You know I ain't ever had a type, having a type takes two
But I know what I like, and you're the only one of you
You're something else (Damn)
And I know we just met, but

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Verse 2]
(I wanna take you home)
I wanna take you home, not just take you home tonight
Get Joanie on the phone, she'll leave us on a light
I wanna see the way you look up under all those stars, yeah
You're gonna be the talk, word's gonna get around
They'll tell you how they thought I'd never settle down
Out on the porch, ain't it funny the way things change?

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait around for the right time

[Chorus]
I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

[Outro]
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks
Woah[Verse 1]
I wasn't tryna feel like this
I wasn't tryna feel nothin' at all
I just came to meet my friends
And try to drink a long week off
I didn't want to stay too late
I wasn't tryna close it down
I was doin' my own thing
Yeah, up until you sat down

[Chorus]
I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah

[Verse 2]
You got me doin' double-takes
You went and messed up all my plans
I only meant to hold this drink
Now I'm tryna hold your hand

[Chorus]
Yeah, I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa
Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa

[Bridge]
You got me catchin' feelin's
I wasn't even tryna feel this
I don't know how you started stealin'
My heart like you are in this bar
But I'm glad that you are

[Chorus]
'Cause I just thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath, oh
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah
Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa
You got me tryna catch my breath, whoa[Verse 1]
I'm jealous of the blue jeans that you're wearing
And the way they're holding you so tight
I'm jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
So lock the door and turn out the night

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall
I want you here in my arms
We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself
To myself

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing
And the way it's rolling off your lips
It might be selfish but I'm thinking
I don't need nothing between you
Leaning for another kiss, yeah

[Chorus]
I want you all to myself
We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall

Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Ooh)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (Shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go? (Ooh)
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (Stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me (Over me)
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
Close to my enemies (Let's go)
I need better energy (Huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
(Yeah, yeah) But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that (Nope)
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I (Ooh)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies (Damn)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Damn)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Bridge: Post Malone]
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around (It's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (Dead to me)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (Tendencies)
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Sometimes, every time, they let me down (They let me down)
Used to have friends, now I got enemies

[Outro: Post Malone]
Ooh, it's too late
It's too late[Verse 1]
We got a pontoon boat with a Yamaha
People dressed like they're in Panama
Small town, spring break
Every weekend 'round this place
And there's a bunch of boys tryna catch the eyes
Of all the pretty girls that are walking by
And those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah
Tan lines and gas station cheap sunglasses
They're coming here from all around

[Chorus]
To get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound

[Verse 2]
Bo got a ticket in a no-wake zone
But Katie's the one that should take it slow
'Cause she's dancin' on the dock and it's only 2 o'clock
Yeah, the fish ain't bitin' 'cause the party's on
The old men are thinkin' 'bout goin' home
But those redneck margaritas are two for one at that old marina, yeah

[Chorus]
We're gonna get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down, yeah
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah
Woo!

[Bridge]
Yeah, we got the rope swing swingin' like a chandelier
Little bit of heaven on the water ride here
Don't need much, just a couple of beers and you and me
Gotta love this time of year
Getting southbound, southbound

[Chorus]
So let's get a little southbound, unwound, Tennessee Honey kinda buzz
Them south sounds up loud, summer drippin' off of us
From the river bank to the Party Cove
Long as it floats, we'll rock the boat
And it's all lookin' up when we get down
And get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Let's get a little southbound, southbound
Get a little southbound, southbound
Oh, yeah[Verse 1]
I ain't watching TV today
Bad news, it can just stay away
If you ain’t got anything good to say
Then shut your mouth
I got my windows down and my blinders on
Radio set to my favorite song
All green lights on the road I'm on
Man, there ain't no doubt

[Chorus]
I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes

[Verse 2]
I ain’t tryna hear the negative
I’m just tryna change the narrative
It's simply imperative
That we all have a damn good time

[Chorus]
I’m getting them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain’t gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
Oh, I'm feeling them good vibes

[Bridge]
I got a good girl
She got a good smile
I kiss her good morning
I kiss her good night
We keep it on the up
That's how we get down
So don't be coming around

[Chorus]
Unless you got them good vibes
I'm living this good life
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
I'm breathing on God's time
And I ain't gonna waste one breath
I'm soaking it all up
I got me a full cup
And there ain't nothing gonna spill it
Nothing gonna kill it
Waving them worries goodbye
I'm feeling them good vibes
Oh, I'm feeling them good vibes
Yeah[Intro]

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop

[Verse 2]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Pre-Chorus]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

Naw, nana, bananana, nanananananana (Nana, ah-ah)
Alright, dada, dadadada

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
(How I stride like that)

[Verse 1: bbno$]
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how (How I guap like that)
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how (How I stride like that)
Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my thanks

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw

I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala

[Verse 2: bbno$]
Haha, I'm at the bank again
They wonder how (How I guap like that)
Pink whip with flames all on the side
They wonder how (How I stride like that)
Got that Gucci on my body, now she tryna pipe me, woo
Popped a Lucy, loosey-goosey, sussy boy, I keep you cool
Got the paper, went to school
Be careful who you callin' fool, ayy, ha, ayy

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I was ridin' ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin’ up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke"

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit

Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck

Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call them chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Interlude: Young Thug]
Cash, money, checks, cash
Addy, Birkin, brand new extendos
I just wanna fuck the bitch by myself
I just passed her to the dawg like my Sprite

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf
Whole sixteen round in the fire
I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out

[Outro: Gunna]
Hot, hot, hot, hot

Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

She got that, mm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That she really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay!
Ven para acá quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mi, estás temblando
Mm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same

I love her lips 'cause she says the words
"Te amo, papi, ah, te amo, papi"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream

So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling

Jump in that water, be free

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Yo
You never live 'til you risk your life (your life)
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice (more ice)
Am I your lover or I'm just your vice? (skktt skktt)
A little crazy, but I'm just your type (ey)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, and my closet his and hers, ayy
I want the lil' mamacita, margarita (margarita)
I’m with the Ed, Cardi B and Camila ey!
I’m just gonna say what I want
Cause whatever people say
I don’t really give a fuck, bitch
Let’s just spread some love
Yeah that’s what everyone wants
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me
You got a boy that could finally do it all
I’ll do everything I can, I’ll tour you all around the world

So join me in this bed that I'm in (oh oh oh)
Push up on me and sweat, darling (oh oh oh oh oh)
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me


Original lyrics by Ed Sheeran
New rap verse written by Yves Laurence[Intro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Ooh

[Verse 1: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Watch  'nother Richard
It's  a million plus three reasons I lied
I couldn't admit it
And I just don't want you to waste my time
'Cause  I'm tryna get with ya
I  be feelin' down but I'm fine when I'm with ya
You be thinkin' I be lyin' when I say I miss you
Girl,  you know I'm on your body, on your body like a tissue
They be callin' you Illuminati when I'm with you (Illuminati when I'm with you)
I say, "Maybe, it's your third eye," I love your mental (Third eye, I love your mental)
VVS's on me look like Now and Laters, lick you up
I  bet you never go back to the guy that was with you (Guy that was with you)
She got every pair of Chanel out of SoHo
Tribeca, hit the city to show off
And when you get dressed up, you take hours
Baby girl, you know you can do whatever, you got...

[Verse 2: Khalid]
Power
Got me sittin' by my phone, I've been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place, mmh, nah
It's crowded
In LA, but I'll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you're down, I could show you around if you're really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?
What do you say?

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Verse 3: Khalid]
Saved
Got the weed, we can sit by the beach if we wanna get faded
But if that's not the vibe, yeah, it's cool
We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we've been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back

[Bridge: Khalid]
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (Bring it back to me, yeah)
So bring it, so bring it
So bring it, so bring it back (No no, no, oh yeah)

[Chorus: Khalid]
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right back
Honestly, it's better like that
I know we've been falling off track
Bring it right back
I just let the time roll past
We don't gotta take it too fast
Bring it right back
You don't gotta stay the night
I just wanna take the time
I know all the things you like
Maybe if the mood is right
We can bring it right[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga put the whole damn hood on, huh
Patron of the New, I had put the drip on
Ask me how many niggas I done put on
My private planes 'bout to fly with the good old
I fuck with bougie bitches, fuck a hood ho
Hit that bitch from the back and told her ditto
Seen the jakes and a nigga had to get low
She looking at the Patek like some Skittles
Her husband been talking tough, I turned her widow
Giuseppe got me on my tip-toe
Why you wifin' on a flip ho?
Brought the strap, I'm playin' give 'n' go
Serving junkies out the window
Tried to rob us, got extendo
We ain't playin', no pretendo

Sipping on this codeine, a nigga gotta speak my mind, mm-mm
I remember we was havin' po-po 'nem behind, yeah, yeah
I'm gettin' money, I can see the hate inside his eyes, yeah, yeah, huh
Fuck a bitch, I had to grab her by the waist
Hit the pussy 'til I knock it outta place
In the V12, get a lot of face
Spare the details, finished on her face
And I had the strap when I caught my case
Just got the grow house started in the Bay
I made a hundred plays in a day
Put an Arabic bitch inside of the face
And I got the hood damn near riding every day
Putting money on the opps, no face, no case

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
Rose gold Rollie, I'm the nigga put the whole damn hood on, huh

Balenciaga wearin' ass nigga
Hoodied up with a mask, nigga

Long johns right under the strap, nigga
That's for you staring ass niggas
Sawed-off head tap, double-tap niggas
That's for you rat niggas
No, I can't do no nine to five
Nah-nah-nah I went to work with the strap, nigga
I came around with five, Roddy came with six

How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you fuckin around with these thots? (A lot)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

[Interlude]
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[Chorus: 21 Savage]

[Interlude: J. Cole]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)
How many times you got shot? (A lot)
How many niggas you shot? (A lot)
How many times did you ride? (A lot)
How many niggas done died? (A lot)
How many times did you cheat? (A lot)
How many times did you lie? (A lot)
How many times did she leave? (A lot)
How many times did she cry? (A lot)
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots (A lot)

You did read it, and it will happen. Post Malone has recently joined the exclusive list of artists to perform on Virtual Reality. The concert, scheduled for 17 of October will take place on the Raleigh’s PNC Arena, and streamed through the Oculus Venue app. So everyone who owns an Oculus headset will be able to watch the concert on a 180 perspective through Oculus Venues.

Post Malone is ready to “Bend Minds”, according to Billboard, and they are not wrong, the concert is going to be one of the increasing amounts of events to be streamed on VR this year, through the Oculus Venue app.

The Raleigh’s PNC Arena, in North Carolina, will hold the event that will be streamed in a 180 degrees perspective through Oculus Venue, an app of the VR company to watch exclusive events through Oculus devices.

The Grammy-winning artist dropped his most recent album, Hollywood’s Bleeding, back in September with some great collaborators, such as Ozzy Osborne and Travis Scott in the track “Take What You Want”, and Halsey alongside Future for “Die For Me”. The record also includes the singles “Wow” and “Sunflower” (Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse) featuring Swae Lee, both reaching the top 10 of the Global Chart on Spotify.

Malone talked about the concert and according to Variety stated that “When putting together this tour, I wanted to make sure I was giving my fans something new and crazy with this new production and show.“ Later adding that “Working with Oculus on this VR broadcast gives fans at home a chance to sit front row with me during my North Carolina show, just like you’re in the arena. That sounds pretty f***ing cool to me.”

PREVIOUS CONCERTS BROADCASTED ON VR
The concert will make Austin Richard Post Aka Post Malone, one of the few people to have done this kind of show. Still, among important artists who have done it before there are Billie Eilish, who did it a month ago, and Tenacious D.

Tenacious D went out to do it on July 31st and many agree saying that it was a success and that the experience actually made it more comfortable. An unexpected advantage of “different state legislation” for some people, as it is mentioned in this article from The Cult Machine.
Moving a little closer on time, on September 3rd, we were able to see Billie Eilish’s concert being streamed on VR, using Oculus Venues as the platform as well. Eilish played in Madrid, Spain, and according to many articles, the experience and opinions may vary a lot, as it is explained in this article from the UploadVR.

According to iHeartRadio, she talked about the concert stating that "I make everybody get really low, and we all jump when the drop comes in. Even though you'll be watching on a VR headset, you should still get low and jump with everyone."

Besides music, there’s a lot of exclusive events that plan on going towards Virtual Reality, including the NBA. Last September they announced their collaboration with many VR platform to broadcast about 26 games starting this October. It is likely that soon you can watch the NFL season and bet on the Superbowl favorites, using VR technology.

VR HAS TAKEN OVER THE LAST YEAR
Although the recent concerts of some of the biggest stars of the moment have made VR reach a spotlight, there are a couple of extra apps that have taken a step forward on this remark. They are having thesigning deals with some of the biggest record labels and allowing us to feel we are on the crowds of different concerts, events or even festivals.

It is safe to say that Virtual Reality keeps breaking walls but is also worth to think for a minute how this could affect the trends, the attendances to concerts and many other factors. Also, what could change into the VR Apps for this kind of shows, if microtransactions are a possibility or any possible alteration in the near future.[Intro]

Hotels are made for two night stays, checking in and out
Meeting strangers in the lobby
Waking up and leaving town the next day
But love ain't
And whiskey's poured for when you're bored
And alone on Friday night
When you want to lose yourself
And need a place to hide from all the pain
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

[Verse 2]
Sad movies are for crying on the couch there in the dark
That sad song it was written just to try and get your heart to break
But love ain't

[Chorus]
Love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't

[Bridge]
(Love ain't)
I wonder what he's doing
(Love ain't)
Feeling like a fool
(And you can't)
Keep letting him do it to you

[Chorus]
'Cause love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone
Love ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone
The way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
I may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't
Come over, let me show you what he can't
'Cause he can only show you what love ain't
Love ain't (Love ain't), oh yeah (Love ain't)
Love ain't[Verse 1]
You know Lil Ced, that's my nigga, I made him a millionaire, fuck it, we all rich
I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Know this money bring envy, you probably wan' be me, but bro, we can't beef 'bout no small shit
Overseas, got the crowd doin' moshpits
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
Businessman, went and got me an office
Million dollar deals, I get 'em often
Me and Dolla was servin' on Sparks Street
Hot lil' jit, he gon' stay with the chopstick
I got robbed, that shit made me a monster
Eviction notice, my sister, my mamas
Now they houses as big as they want 'em
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
Livin' like we in a race, I might come in first or second, but I won't ever be last
Lately I been in my bag
Bro told me don't take my foot off the gas
If they give you a inch, go'n and take you a mile
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
City to city, got girls goin' wild
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, "I can't"
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you, I run with them snakes
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
Watch how I move with this paper, I know if I slip up one time they gon' try to come take it
Real as it get and these niggas be fakin', I don't want they vibes, so they hand I ain't shakin'
She on that '42 straight with no chaser
I'm tryna get out of here and go taste her, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, "Stop breathin'"
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah

Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah
Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
Sit that cat on my lap, I give it good strokes
I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
Or maybe to Japan so I can hit her like I'm Ichiro
She knows what the fuck is up, I don't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak
I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace
Head got me wobblin'
She know I got cameras, she say, "We should vlog it"
I know she got stamina, she said, "Start joggin'," yeah

[Chorus: Russ & BIA]

She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around

[Verse 2: BIA]
Light me up (Light me up), light me up
I done seen the whole world and ain't no one as hot as us
Bankrolls, dank rolled, they ain't really as loud as us
I be hopin' that it's love, but it really just be the lust
Anything for a rush now, it's Van Nuys on the touchdown
It's a cold world, get a bust down
How you get my mind before my body and my trust now?
He say life is too short and he think that we should fuck now
I think I'm finna break him, it's gon' be quick
He know I ride that dick 'til I get seasick
Wavy lil' bitch to talk that East shit
Nasty, but don't put nothin' past me
Now I got the pussy and the power if you ask me

[Chorus: Russ & BIA]
Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around

Look see
Everybody hatin when i'm buzzin like a satellite givin off a wave
Ta the earth for the kids
That's TV
People wanna say, they wanna fight n get the kids all hype
Like a crowd in the night
No pg
A kid a doing it right you never knew me
But i'm coming around the corner kinda dark and no
Can't see me
I tryna to be the one who's always talkin, when i think and let it out n let it go like
Free weed

[Verse]

Sorry that i gotta be the one ta flip it off
But i told you ima king, so better think twice
Of lyin on a track while comin against me
I'm fiendin to give thoughts, don't plan to be nice
So i gotta give a hundred when i'm runnin
When i'm jumpin on a mic, ima say whats in my head
I don't care about the cost, i faught for the spot that i rock
Straight raw, home grown, I don't care if you talkin

Name up in your throat like coughin
No stoppin cuz i'm sick like your mom so often
I'm back up from the ground, like the dead, In a coffin
Got a bat wit a nickname, lucy, call it
Steppin in the game like look
Callin all these Mother f****** out on the truth, then the wallet
Ill be gettin what i want In the end quit stallin
I'm ready for the fun, I've been done, gonna run this

I don't wanna hear you f****** say, 'where i'm from b****  ?'
Its all up on google n now who the dumb b****
Lookin for a reason bro, for me to get dumb rich
So never am i done doin better by minute
When i'm lifted, I be gifted, when i gimmick
Wit the image like boss
I'm fully automatic, I'm n addict in the halls
Trippin like the days i was takin adderall n i'm talkin kid days
Sorry had to do it mom
Said i had to focus everyday when i was young
Took it to level now look what i become
Kxng jay, don't play
Everyday ima in the lab wit ammunition for the punks

Still pickin around the world, tell the rats from snakes
Dumb stickin around ta see how it ends aye
Livin in Atlanta full of graves n dealin wit allizeh
A holy legend fading the hell away
I met him downtown i should have known tho
Atlanta try to play you in a sick way
Be ready for the set up you gon get played
By every mother f***** that's the broke way
Learned first hand two years wit paid slots
Don't be tryna play the artist workin harder then your pops
From the 50's n 60's respect me or not
Cuz the time within my life is all i got
I took shot. My aim is good
You better watch from the city ta hoods
I'm telling these kids, If you dream then its good n to follow that s***, when you know that you should

Jay back like a tic
I'm buggin, I'm gettin pissed
Working this really hard n nobody see how lit
It's really gonna be the minute we hit a shift
N everybody lookin be patient i'm comin big, wit the steps now
Walkin the road slow I keep cool now, ooh wow
How he spittin venom, I gettin em n never sweat it
Don't forget it, make em get it like a dube cloud
Prouder then a mother f**** spittin all the truth out

Never playing wit the 808's, I don't plan ta get away
Until the day i got to, when it come I'm gonna make way
Pirate wit the life, only tryna make the dope bay
Paddle wit the raft in the tide, ain't a joke aye
We gonna get a bottle gonna chill up in the sand
Got da brother in boat n he goin full throttle
Jay up on the finger tip, baby girls fishin
Please just hear, when you do start bloggin

Aye, lemme slow this up
Lemme say this clear, for the stupid f****
Wit a slow mind, a homie had enough
But ima say this once in case you do respond
If you wanna hear what i gotta say
Wit so many words i can do that
Its only three words, said back ta back
Its 'YOU ARE A B****', so learn to read fast
Had so many years ta learn here
But lemme be clear, you'll burn here
I'm up in the world, its my work yeh
I'm gonna get what i deserve b****
Until ima corpse in the floor near
A bag full of weed buried under a stage wit the mic in my hand
Cuz ill never change, i'm climbin this game its my turn yeh

But when i get attackin, i'm taggin, i'm gonna drag em
When they rappin, when i say its gonna happen, Its gon happen
Ain't no question on the matter, i'm handle all the hatters
Haters
Braggin everyday bein hella instigators on the side be talkin I see the plot, you be hatin on a nigga tryna get up in the spot
N ima get it better watch, n get you mad like ha
Cuz you tryna be like me, man ill see you at the top

Spittin all the cold on the earth for the genocide
Ain't nowhere to go you better hide before the homicide
Promise ima get it cuz im Ready for the punks
Is there anything i missed, death, yeh
Global warming this is all a mess
Tryna give a warning yes

[Hook][Chorus]
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)
SportsCenter, top ten

[Verse]
I could put the ball in the end zone, put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro, Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh

Told her don't let her friends know (Don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion, I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction, I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction, that's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then (Nah)
My swag, they keep jackin' (Keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin' (Quit askin')

[Chorus]
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)

When I'm underneath the bright lights
When I'm tryna have a good time
'Cause I'm good now you ain't mine
Now, now, now, now, don't call me up
When you're looking at my photos
Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more

And now you're tryna hit me up again
Now, now, now, now

Look, uh, look

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice ’cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

[Verse]
While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

[Chorus]
Heart been broke so many times I don't know what to believe
Mama say it’s my fault, it's my fault, I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice 'cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me
